Horizontal area, vertical extension, school shape and relative density were quantified using sonar and echosounder, and related to gonad maturation stage and stomach fullness recorded from gillnet samples. The majority of the herring completed spawning within 3 d. During this period, the herring were feeding and predatory fish were present in the area. An extended cylindrical school shape prior to spawning indicated that individual herring within the school had different depth preferences, with ripe individuals descending towards the spawning substrate on the bottom while immature individuals preferred the pelagic environment for safety and feeding. As the majority of the fish matured, the school segregated vertically into a pelagic component that contracted to a tight ball and a demersal component that spread out in a flat layer on the bottom. Post-spawners seemed to return to the pelagic school. After spawning, the 2 components rejoined each other and formed a loose flake (i.e. loose, uneven layer) at the surface. Schooling fish have traditionally been considered to make 1 of 3 behavioural decisions: to stay, join or leave a school. Waiting without losing contact with the rest of the school, 'await', is suggested as a fourth option.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2000,103354meps205259,"Marine Res Inst, N-5817 Bergen, Norway./Bergen High Technol Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Marine Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.","Axelsen, BE (reprint author), Marine Res Inst, POB 1870 Nordnes, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.",10_3354_meps205259

Travelling rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) either exhibit asynchronous movements or an extremely synchronized swimming behaviour in tight formations, which we expect to facilitate eavesdropping. Therefore, we determined, whether either one or more dolphins were echolocating in subgroups that were travelling with asynchronous and synchronized movements. Since, the number of recording sequences in which more than one animal produced sonar signals was significantly lower during synchronized travel, we conclude that the other members of a subgroup might get information on targets ahead by eavesdropping. Synchronized swimming in tight formations might be an energetic adaptation for travelling in a pelagic dolphin species that facilitates eavesdropping.",ROYAL SOC,MAR 22,2006,101098rsbl20050407,"Univ Tubingen, Inst Zool, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany./German Oceanog Museum, D-18439 Stralsund, Germany.","Gotz, T (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, Sea Mammal Res Unit, Gatty Marine Lab, Sch Biol, East Sands, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",1617177

Recent studies have applied a model-driven approach to classifying and quantifying animal movement from global positioning system (GPS) location data. We improve upon these methods by 1) revising model structure to provide a simple biologically-defensible basis to reduce misclassification; 2) introducing a data-efficient tool that can be used to quantify and circumvent model sensitivity to starting location; and 3) illustrating how existing models can be adapted to describe short-distance migration, using elevational migration as an example. These improvements are included in 'migrateR', an open source R package that expands and automates model-driven classification and quantification of animal movement behavior. We demonstrate the software and these improved methods using GPS-collar location data from a long-distance migrant, elk Cervus elaphus, and a short-distance elevational migrant, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis sierrae.

Matthiopoulos, Jason",NA,NA,NA,"1. Impediments to animal movement are ubiquitous and vary widely in both scale and permeability. It is essential to understand how impediments alter ecological dynamics via their influence on animal behavioural strategies governing space use and, for anthropogenic features such as roads and fences, how to mitigate these effects to effectively manage species and landscapes.
2. Here, we focused primarily on barriers to movement, which we define as features that cannot be circumnavigated but may be crossed. Responses to barriers will be influenced by the movement capabilities of the animal, its proximity to the barriers, and habitat preference. We developed a mechanistic modelling framework for simultaneously quantifying the permeability and proximity effects of barriers on habitat preference and movement.
3. We used simulations based on our model to demonstrate how parameters on movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability can be estimated statistically. We then applied the model to a case study of road effects on wild mountain reindeer summer movements.
4. This framework provided unbiased and precise parameter estimates across a range of strengths of preferences and barrier permeabilities. The quality of permeability estimates, however, was correlated with the number of times the barrier is crossed and the number of locations in proximity to barriers. In the case study we found that reindeer avoided areas near roads and that roads are semi-permeable barriers to movement. There was strong avoidance of roads extending up to c. 1 km for four of five animals, and having to cross roads reduced the probability of movement by 68.6% (range 3.5-99.5%).
5. Human infrastructure has embedded within it the idea of networks: nodes connected by linear features such as roads, rail tracks, pipelines, fences and cables, many of which divide the landscape and limit animal movement. The unintended but potentially profound consequences of infrastructure on animals remain poorly understood. The rigorous framework for simultaneously quantifying movement, habitat preference and barrier permeability developed here begins to address this knowledge gap.",NA,JAN,2016,1.01111136526561E+018,NA,NA,NA

However, these approaches rarely consider conflicts of interest between group members, although there is reason to suppose that such conflicts are commonplace. Here, we demonstrate that, where conflicts exist, individual members of self-organizing groups can, in principle, increase their influence on group movement destination by strategically changing simple behavioral parameters (namely, movement speed, assertiveness, and social attraction range). However, they do so at the expense of an increased risk of group fragmentation and a decrease in movement efficiency. We argue that the resulting trade-offs faced by each group member render it likely that group movements are led by those members for which reaching a particular destination is most crucial or group cohesion is least important. We term this phenomenon leading according to ""need"" or ""social indifference,"" respectively. Both kinds of leading can occur in the absence of knowledge of or communication about the needs of other group members and without the assumption of altruistic cooperation.

While, the direct observation of behaviour is often limited due to logistical constraints, collection of movement data has been greatly facilitated through the development of bio-logging. Movement data obtained through tracking instrumentation may potentially constitute a relevant proxy to infer behaviour.
2. To infer behaviour from movement data is a key focus within the ""movement ecology"" discipline. Statistical learning constitutes a number of methods that can be used to assess the link between given variables from a fully informed training dataset and then predict the values on a non-informed variable. We chose the random forest algorithm for its high prediction accuracy and its ease of implementation. The strength of random forest partly lies in its ability to handle a very large number of variables. Our methodology is accordingly based on the derivation of multiple predictor variables from movement data over various temporal scales, to capture as much information as possible from changes and variations in movement.
3. The methodology is described in four steps, using examples on foraging seabirds and fishing vessels for illustration. The models showed very high prediction accuracy (92%-97%), thereby confirming the influence of behaviour on movement decisions and demonstrating the ability to derive multiple variables from movement data to predict behaviour with random forests.
4. The codes developed for this methodology are published in the ""M2B"" (Movement to Behaviour) R package, available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=m2b. They can be used and adapted to datasets where movement was sampled from a wide range of taxa, sampling schemes or tracking devices.

Six field-tagged fish (1.5-7.5 kg) were monitored for 45-115 days before tracking was terminated. Tracking patterns of fish indicated no apparent effect of these large, external transmitters on movement behavior; further, the transmitters did not appear to entangle the fish in vegetation. One fish with its transmitter still secure was recaptured after 54 days, and there was minimal tissue erosion under the transmitter. With minor improvements for the attachment lines and the transmitter saddle, the method is suitable for externally attaching large telemetry transmitters to fish. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Specifically, a short-time energy-based approach is used to extract the gait pattern. Moreover, in order to improve the accuracy of vertical distance estimation while the person is climbing upstairs, a state classification is designed to distinguish the walking status including plane motion (i.e., normal walking and jogging horizontally), walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Furthermore, we also provide a mechanism to reduce the vertical distance accumulation error.

Mean transect values, after bottom removal, are extrapolated to provide an estimate of number or biomass within a survey area. Over the past 20 years, many multibeam sonars have been developed but these systems which are commonly employed to collect detailed bathymetric and seafloor-type data, have been designed to remove mid-water returns. Only recently has a multibeam sonar been developed that allows for continuous digital recording of mid-water returns. For fisheries acoustics, the movement from single-beam to multibeam surveys provides a mechanism to greatly enhance the area and volume of coverage. The large volume of data generated by these systems, however, presents serious challenges for analysis and interpretation. This paper describes initial studies related to the transition from single to multibeam applications including the types of equipment investigated, the limitations of several acoustic systems examined, and how geomatics and 3D visualization can be used to enhance our knowledge of pelagic fish schools. Early results indicate that multibeam sonars, in conjunction with 3D visualization software can be powerful tools for assessing fish stocks, investigating fish school behavior, for exploring habitat preferences and for addressing questions related to vessel avoidance. As the technology improves so will the capability to investigate and to incorporate additional multiparameter data such as water column properties and bottom type and as calibration techniques are developed for multibeam sonars estimates of biomass may also be possible.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,FEB,2002,101006jmsc20011125,"Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Chase Ocean Engn Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USA./Univ New Brunswick, Ocean Mapping Grp, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada./Univ New Brunswick, Ocean Mapping Grp, Dept Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada./Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Marine Fish Div, Biol Stn, St Andrews, NB E0G 2X0, Canada.","Mayer, L (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Chase Ocean Engn Lab, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",NA

This is especially true for bats, whose small size and cryptic lifestyles make them challenging to study. However, only a handful of studies have evaluated how transmitter mass and the attachment method affect bat behaviour or health, and none have assessed the development of technical methods in the field.
We review the past 50years of bat tracking studies to determine how devices have been attached, how guidelines have been followed or changed, and whether any health or fitness impacts from these transmitters can be determined.
Half of the nearly 300 studies available used devices heavier than the recommended 5% of body mass with minimal justification. Devices were typically glued directly to the backs of small bats and remained attached for 9days. This is far shorter than battery life span of most devices. Little information is available regarding the overall impact of attaching transmitters on the health, survival and reproductive success of bats, and there has been little development in attachment methods since the first tracking studies.
We consequently developed a collar for small bats with a degradable weak link and tested it on several species. The collar worked successfully on three of four species. This allows longer habituation and tracking times while ensuring that the device drops off after the battery expires.
Future studies will need to invest more effort in assessing potential long-term effects of tracking. They also need to build upon previous knowledge to find the best attachment method, size and shape for their study species to effectively improve wildlife tracking.",WILEY,APR,2014,1011112041210X12172,"[O'Mara, M.

"A ""death trap"" in the landscape of fear",3975,"Schmidt, Krzysztof
Kuijper, Dries P. J.",NA,NA,NA,"A crucial element in the ""the landscape of fear"" concept is that prey animals are aware of varying levels of predation risk at a spatial scale. This often leads to a negative spatial relationship between prey and predator in which prey avoid the most risky sites in the landscape. In this paper, we argue that our understanding of large carnivore-ungulate interactions is biased by studies from highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. the Yellowstone National Park). Due to a high availability of refuges and foraging sites in such landscapes, prey are able to reduce predation risk by showing habitat shifts. Besides the spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale, the ungulate response to predation risk can be affected by the hunting mode (stalking vs. cursorial) of the predator. We propose that prey cannot easily avoid predation risk by moving to less risky habitats in more homogenous landscapes with concentrated food resources, especially where the large carnivores' assemblage includes both stalking and cursorial species. No distinct refuges for prey may occur in such landscapes due to equally high accessibility to predators in all habitats, while concentrated resources make prey distribution more predictable. We discuss a model of a densely forested landscape based on a case study of the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland. Within this landscape, ungulates focus their foraging activity on small food-rich forest gaps, which turn out to be ""death traps"" as the gaps are primarily targeted by predators (stalking lynx and cursorial wolf) while hunting. No alternative of moving to low predation risk areas exist for prey due to risk from wolves in surrounding closed-canopy forest. As a result, the prey is exposed to constant high predation pressure in contrast to heterogeneous landscapes with less concentrated resources and more refuge areas. Future research should focus on explaining how ungulates are coping with predation risk in these landscapes that offer little choice of escaping predation by considering behavioural and physiological (e.g. metabolic, hormonal) responses.",NA,OCT,2015,101007s133640150229x,NA,NA,NA

For the first time, a radar front-end and its antenna are integrated on a multilayer cellulose-based substrate, built-up by alternating paper, glue and metal layers. The circuit exploits a distributed microstrip structure that is realized using a copper adhesive laminate, so as to obtain a low-loss conductor.

In order to study the role of visual feedback in goal-driven navigation, we developed a 2D visual virtual reality system for zebrafish larvae. The visual feedback can be set to be similar to what the animal experiences in natural conditions. Alternatively, modification of the visual feedback can be used to study how the brain adapts to perturbations. For this purpose, we first generated a library of free-swimming behaviors from which we learned the relationship between the trajectory of the larva and the shape of its tail. Then, we used this technique to infer the intended displacements of head-fixed larvae, and updated the visual environment accordingly. Under these conditions, larvae were capable of aligning and swimming in the direction of a whole-field moving stimulus and produced the fine changes in orientation and position required to capture virtual prey. We demonstrate the sensitivity of larvae to visual feedback by updating the visual world in real-time or only at the end of the discrete swimming episodes. This visual feedback perturbation caused impaired performance of prey-capture behavior, suggesting that larvae rely on continuous visual feedback during swimming.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,SEP 23,2016,101038srep34015,"[Jouary, Adrien; Haudrechy, Mathieu; Sumbre, German] PSL Res Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Ecole Normale Super,IBENS, F-75005 Paris, France./[Candelier, Raphael] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Lab Jean Perrin, UMR 8237, F-75005 Paris, France.","Sumbre, G (reprint author), PSL Res Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Ecole Normale Super,IBENS, F-75005 Paris, France.",5034285

paradisi","Flying snake species (Chrysopelea) locomote through the air despite a lack of appendages or any obvious external morphological specialization for flight. Here photogrammetric techniques were used to investigate C paradisi's aerial trajectory in three dimensions. Two videocameras arranged in stereo were used to record head, midpoint and vent landmarks on snakes that jumped from a horizontal branch at a height of 9.62 m and landed in an open field. The coordinates of these landmarks were reconstructed in three dimensions and used to analyze patterns of position, glide angle and speed concurrently with changes in body posture in 14 glide sequences from different individuals. C paradisi's trajectory was composed of a ballistic dive followed by a shallowing phase in which the path became more horizontal; for most glide trials, no equilibrium phase was observed. In the ballistic dive, the snake changed posture from generally straight to a wide 'S' shape in planview and began aerial undulation. Shortly after the ballistic dive, the snake's speed transitioned from an initial acceleration to stable or to a different rate of increase or decrease. Aerial undulation, in which high-amplitude traveling waves pass posteriorly down the body, was a prominent locomotor behavior. In mid-glide, this undulation occurred with the anterior body oriented approximately parallel with the ground and the posterior body cycling up and down in the vertical plane. The body angle of attack for the anterior body for one trial was 20-40 degrees. Snakes traveled a horizontal distance of 10.14 +/- 2.69 m (mean +/- S.D.) while reaching an airspeed of 10.0 +/- 0.9 m s(-1), sinking speed of 6.4 +/- 0.8 m s(-1) and horizontal speed of 8.1 +/- 0.9 m s-1. The glide path shallowed at a rate of 20 +/- 6 degrees s(-1) and reached a minimum glide angle of 28 +/- 10 degrees, with a minimum recorded glide angle of 13 degrees. C paradisi are surprisingly good gliders given their unconventional locomotor style, with performance characteristics that rival or surpass more familiar gliding taxa such as flying squirrels. As in other gliders, C paradisi is potentially capable of using aerial locomotion to move effectively between trees, chase aerial prey, or avoid predators.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,MAY,2005,101242jeb01579,"Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA./Leica Geosyst Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore 609916, Singapore.","Socha, JJ (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Organismal Biol & Anat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",NA

In shore-based accuracy trials, a system with a 50-cm stereo baseline had an average range estimation error of 0.09 m at a 5-m distance increasing up to 3.2 at 50 m. The system is especially useful in field situations where it is necessary to follow groups of animals travelling over relatively long distances and time periods whilst obtaining individual positions with high spatial and temporal resolution (up to 8 Hz). These positions provide quantitative estimates of a variety of key parameters and indicators for behavioural studies such as inter-animal distances, group dispersion, speed and heading. This system can additionally be integrated with other techniques such as archival tags, photo-identification methods or acoustic playback experiments to facilitate fieldwork investigating topics ranging from natural social behaviour to how animals respond to anthropogenic disturbance.

This hypothesis is supported by several studies that use computational models to simulate natural evolution. These studies, however, either tune an ad-hoc model to 'reproduce' collective behaviour, or concentrate on a single type of predation pressure, or infer the emergence of collective behaviour from an increase in prey density. In nature, prey are often targeted by multiple predator species simultaneously and this might have played a pivotal role in the evolution of collective behaviour. We expand on previous research by using an evolutionary rule-based system to simulate the evolution of prey behaviour when prey are subject to multiple simultaneous predation pressures. We analyse the evolved behaviour via prey density, polarization, and angular momentum. Our results suggest that a mixture of antagonistic external pressures that simultaneously steer prey towards grouping and dispersing might be required for prey individuals to evolve dynamic parallel movement.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,DEC 20,2016,101038srep39428,"[Demsar, Jure; Strumbelj, Erik; Bajec, Iztok Lebar] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.","Demsar, J (reprint author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Comp & Informat Sci, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.",NA

Barriers to animal movement affect the evolution and trajectory of populations. Investigators have attempted to use traffic volume, the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to traffic volume as a tool to predict barrier effects from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes traffic volume as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of traffic volume. Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when traffic volume increases. Hence, highway barrier effects are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high traffic volumes. Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as traffic volume increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low traffic volumes. Hence, avoidance causes barrier effects more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate traffic volumes. By considering a species' risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct.",WILEY,APR,2016,101002ecs21345,"[Jacobson, Sandra L.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Davis, CA 95618 USA./[Bliss-Ketchum, Leslie L.; de Rivera, Catherine E.] Portland State Univ, Sch Environm, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97207 USA./[Smith, Winston P.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, La Grande, OR 97850 USA./[Smith, Winston P.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.","Jacobson, SL (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Davis, CA 95618 USA.",NA

In order to understand this pattern I performed experiments at two levels. First, at the community level, I evaluated the importance of competition, predation, and pond permanence for patterns of larval performance. Second, at the behavioral level, I asked whether a hypothesized trade-off between gain and risk underlies ecological interactions, and ultimately, patterns of performance and distribution of these species.
I employed a field manipulation to assess the contributions of competition and predation within different ponds that varied in permanence. In order to examine the effect of interspecific competition, enclosures contained each tadpole species either alone or in the presence of an equal density of the other species; these enclosures were placed in two temporary ponds, two intermediate ponds, and two permanent ponds. Tadpole stocking densities reflected local natural densities. This competition treatment was crossed with a predator treatment manipulating the absence or presence of predators (with ''presence'' representing the naturally occurring density within each pond). Patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across the pond permanence gradient: chorus frogs performed best relative to spring peepers in temporary ponds while spring peepers performed best relative to chorus frogs in permanent ponds (performance was measured as survivorship and growth). The dominant sources of mortality were pond drying in temporary ponds and predation in more permanent ponds. In contrast to most previous experimental studies of larval anurans, competition had small effects on tadpole performance.
Results from the held experiment suggest that pond drying and predation may be important determinants of performance, and that the two species are differentially susceptible to these mortality agents. In a set of laboratory experiments I evaluated the hypothesis that a trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk mediated through activity (proportion of time spent moving) might explain patterns of Pseudacris distribution. In both species, individuals facultatively reduced activity in the presence of a caged predator with a corresponding drop in growth rate. In general, larval chorus frogs also tend to be more active and faster growing and developing than spring peepers. These results provide support for the existence of the trade-off and suggest that interspecific differences in activity may contribute to patterns of larval performance and distribution among ponds. The general nature of this trade-off suggests that it may also be important in other systems.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,JAN,1995,1023071940638,"UNIV MICHIGAN,DEPT BIOL,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109.",NA,NA

Explicitly including information about behavioral strategies in population viability analyses may enhance the ability of conservation biologists to understand and estimate patterns of extinction risk. Nevertheless, most behavioral-based PVA approaches require detailed individual-based data that are rarely available for imperiled species. We present a mechanistic approach that incorporates spatial and demographic consequences of behavioral strategies into population models used for conservation. We developed a stage-structured matrix model that includes the costs and benefits of movement associated with 2 habitat-selection strategies (philopatry and direct assessment). Using a life table for California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), we explored the sensitivity of model predictions to the inclusion of these behavioral parameters. Including behavioral information dramatically changed predicted population sizes, model dynamics, and the expected distribution of individuals among sites. Estimated population sizes projected in 100 years diverged up to 1 order of magnitude among scenarios that assumed different movement behavior. Scenarios also exhibited different model dynamics that ranged from stable equilibria to cycles or extinction. These results suggest that inclusion of behavioral data in viability models may improve estimates of extinction risk for imperiled species. Our approach provides a simple method for incorporating spatial and demographic consequences of behavioral strategies into population models and may be easily extended to other species and behaviors to understand the mechanisms of population dynamics for imperiled populations.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,DEC,2008,101111j15231739200800995x,"[Gonzalez-Suarez, Manuela; Gerber, Leah R.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.","Gonzalez-Suarez, M (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Coll & Univ Dr, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",NA

Foraging theory suggests that animal pollinators exhibit preferences for common plant species in natural communities (positive frequency-dependent foraging) and temporary single-species specialization (flower constancy) during foraging bouts. Positive frequency dependence may favor common plant species; flower constancy may enhance conspecific pollen transfer particularly in rare plant species. Previous experimental studies suggest that avian pollinators are unlikely to exhibit these behaviors. We studied foraging behavior of Cape Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), the main avian pollinator of many Protea species, using focal-plant and focal-bird sampling, assisted by high-resolution maps of the spatiotemporal distribution of Protea individuals and their flowering status. We found that Sugarbird's visitation preference increased with species' relative floral abundance, and that individual Sugarbirds tended to visit single species in sequence. Flower constancy during foraging bouts was significantly higher than expected from random plant-animal encounters at the scale of pollinator movements. Positive frequency dependence may favor the reproduction of abundant plant species while flower constancy may be particularly important for rare plant species. This first simultaneous study of both behaviors in a natural plant-pollinator system shows that bird pollinators exhibit both types of behavior and, in this way, possibly influence plant community structure.",WILEY,NOV,2016,101002ecy1565,"[Schmid, B.; Boehning-Gaese, K.; Mueller, T.; Schleuning, M.] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany./[Schmid, B.; Nottebrock, H.; Esler, K.

Declines in global catches and legislation to ban discarding will significantly reduce discards, but this subsidy supports a large scavenger community. Understanding the potential impact of declining discards for scavengers should feature in an eco-system based approach to fisheries management, but requires greater knowledge of scavenger/fishery interactions. Here we use bird-borne cameras, in tandem with GPS loggers, to provide a unique view of seabird/fishery interactions. 20,643 digital images (one min 21) from ten bird-borne cameras deployed on central place northern gannets Morus bassanus revealed that all birds photographed fishing vessels. These were large (>15 m) boats, with no small-scale vessels. Virtually all vessels were trawlers, and gannets were almost always accompanied by other scavenging birds. All individuals exhibited an Area-Restricted Search (ARS) during foraging, but only 42% of ARS were associated with fishing vessels, indicating much 'natural' foraging. The proportion of ARS behaviours associated with fishing boats were higher for males (81%) than females (30%), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Our study illustrates that fisheries form a very important component of the prey-landscape for foraging gannets and that a discard ban, such as that proposed under reforms of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, may have a significant impact on gannet behaviour, particularly males. However, a continued reliance on 'natural' foraging suggests the ability to switch away from scavenging, but only if there is sufficient food to meet their needs in the absence of a discard subsidy.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 6,2013,101371journalpone0057376,"[Votier, Stephen C.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England./[Votier, Stephen C.; Bicknell, Anthony; Cox, Samantha L.; Patrick, Samantha C.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England./[Scales, Kylie L.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, Devon, England./[Patrick, Samantha C.] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France.","Votier, SC (reprint author), Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",10_1371_journal_pone_0057376

The bias was independent of the richness of available self-movement cues. Results are inconsistent with computing individual speeds, relying on constant visual angles, expansion rates, occlusions, or relative distances but are consistent with inducing the impression of relative movement through perceptually compressing and enlarging inter-runner distance.

Precise quantification was made of the time allocated to four modes of behavior: slow-swim (movement of feeding appendages only), break (no appendages moving), fast-swim (posteriorally-directed movement of first antennae and pereiopods), and groom (brushing of first antennae through feeding appendages). Ten copepods each were used for tethered and free-swimming filming. Under both experimental regimes, copepods spent < 1 % of total amount of time in fast-swimming and grooming behavior. Most of the time (50.7-95.5%) animals were on break. The rest of the time (3.8-48.9%) animals were in the slow-swimming mode, moving only feeding appendages. There were no significant differences between tethered and free-swimming animals in mean time allocations to slow-swimming and break behavioral modes.

Knowledge of home range size and site fidelity is essential in determining whether species will benefit from the protection offered by a MPA, the size of the area needed to protect individuals, and the extent to which surrounding unprotected areas may be supplemented through post-recruitment movement or ""spillover"". We utilized a traditional mark and recapture approach, along with GIS spatial analysis to investigate the site fidelity, home range, and homing behavior of the economically important fish species cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) on the south central coast of California. In collaboration with members of the commercial live-fish fishery, a total of 1240 sub-adult and adult cabezon were tagged during 10 days of fishing from September to December of 2004 along similar to 18 km of coastline. A public awareness and reward program resulted in 330 total recaptures from 290 different individuals (23% recapture rate) with recaptured individuals at liberty up to 1000 days after initial tagging. A majority of individuals displayed high site fidelity, with 81% of recapture events occurring within 100 m of their initial capture locations, and only 9 individuals (.03%) recaptured greater than 1 km. Most individuals (64%) displayed home ranges less than 1000 m(2). Ten individuals recaptured after experiencing translocation of up to 5.3 km displayed strong homing behavior, returning to within 14 m of their initial capture locations. Findings suggest that under circumstances where suitable habitat is available in nearby unprotected areas, that adult ""spillover"" will likely be limited to areas within 100 m from MPA boundaries. In addition, the size of the area needed to protect individual cabezon, should be at least 1000 m(2). Findings from this study demonstrate many of the potential benefits of scientists and fishers working together to investigate area use patterns of economically important fish species to facilitate future design and assessment of MPAs.

Accelerometers afford a sensitive platform for doing so and have demonstrated their use in many human-based trials and interventions. Current state of the art methods for predicting sleep from accelerometer signals are either based on posture or low movement. While both have proven to be sensitive in humans, the methods do not directly transfer well to dogs, possibly because dogs are commonly alert but physically inactive when recumbent. In this paper, we combine a previously validated low-movement algorithm developed for humans and a posture-based algorithm developed for dogs. The hybrid approach was tested on 12 healthy dogs of varying breeds and sizes in their homes. The approach predicted state of rest with a mean accuracy of 0.86 (SD = 0.08). Furthermore, when a dog was in a resting state, the method was able to distinguish between head up and head down posture with a mean accuracy of 0.90 (SD = 0.08).

In this paper, we investigate human mobility patterns through analyzing taxi-trace datasets collected from five metropolitan cities in two countries. We focus on three statistics for each dataset: the displacement of each occupied trip, the duration of each occupied trip, and the time interval between successive occupied trips by the same taxi (interevent time). The results indicate that the displacement distributions of human travel by taxi tend to follow exponential laws in two displacement ranges rather than power laws; the trip duration distributions can be approximated by log-normal distributions; the interevent time distributions can be well characterized by log-normal bodies followed by power law tails. For each considered measure, the rescaled distributions of all cities collapsed into a master curve. These results provide empirical evidence supporting the common regularity of intra-city human mobility. Moreover, we show that airport locations could play a role in explaining the spikes of displacement distributions of taxi trips in certain cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They enhance large multispecific aggregations of individuals, with strong ecological consequences. It is challenging to predict how individuals or species can differ in their reaction to these resources. For instance, there are wide variations in seabird species abundance behind fishing boats, and individual variations in interaction rates. Whether this is reflecting variations in fine-scale encounter rates or rather variations in attraction strength is poorly quantified. Here we compare the response of Wandering (WA) and Black-browed (BBA) albatrosses to fishing boats operating in sub-Antarctic waters. We use GPS tracking data from both birds and boats (Vessel Monitoring System). Attraction distances were similar between the 2 species (up to 30 km). BBA foraged further from fishing grounds and encountered boats less frequently than WA, but once they encountered a boat BBA were more strongly attracted (80% vs. 60% chance) and had a higher level of active interaction, compared to WA. Furthermore, in the absence of boats, BBA were rarely observed foraging over the habitat where the fisheries mainly operate, in contrast with WA. We thus report qualitative and quantitative differences in the response of these 2 species to the same fishing fleet. WA, the larger, more dominant and more generalist species was unexpectedly less attracted to fishing vessels. Comparing our results with previously published studies, we suggest that energetic requirements of individuals may be a crucial predictor for assessing risks of interactions with anthropogenic food resources.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,SEP-OCT,2017,101093behecoarx097,"[Collet, Julien; Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ La Rochelle, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UMR 7372, 405 Route Prisse Charriere, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France./[Patrick, Samantha C.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.","Collet, J (reprint author), Univ La Rochelle, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UMR 7372, 405 Route Prisse Charriere, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",NA

A lure moving at speed represents an artificial prey item that the cursorial cheetah can pursue, therefore allowing it to perform an important hunting behavior within a captive setting. This study was conducted in order to highlight how employing different forms of this type of enrichment may influence its efficacy. This is important in relation to the future development of an optimum type of cheetah run enrichment which maximizes the potential beneficial effects and therefore positively impacts upon cheetah welfare in captivity. Video recordings were carried out at three separate institutions (Fota Wildlife Park, Ireland; Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre, South Africa; Cheetah Conservation Fund, Namibia). Randomization tests were carried out to compare the highest speeds attained between males and females, trained and untrained cheetahs and also between the three institutions. Females and trained individuals reached significantly higher speeds compared with males and untrained individuals, respectively. The only significant difference between the three institutions was between the Ann van Dyk Cheetah Centre and the Cheetah Conservation Fund, where cheetahs at the Ann van Dyk center reached significantly higher speeds. The current study represents the first detailed study of any aspect of the cheetah run across multiple institutions.

The use of new devices which are capable of measuring inertial movements by means of built-in accelerometers enable the PA to be measured objectively on the basis of the reckoning of counts. These devices are also known as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and each count is an aggregated value indicating the intensity of a movement and can be used in conjunction with other parameters to determine the MET rate of a particular physical activity and thus it's associated EE. Various types of inertial devices currently exist that enable count calculus and physical activity to be monitored. The advent of mobile devices, such as smartphones, with empowered computation capabilities and integrated inertial sensors, has enabled EE to be measure in a distributed, ubiquitous and natural way, thereby overcoming the reluctance of users and practitioners associated with in-lab studies. From the point of view of the process analysis and infrastructure needed to manage data from inertial devices, there are also various differences in count computing: extra devices are required, out-of-device processing, etc. This paper presents a study to discover whether the estimation of energy expenditure is dependent on the accelerometer of the device used in measurements and to discover the suitability of each device for performing certain physical activities.

Acoustic monitoring allows long-term tracking of marine animal movement that is traditionally analysed using kernel-based home range estimators. These traditional methods, however, are limited because they do not examine movement pathways within activity spaces. Network analysis (NA) provides an alternative approach to traditional home range analysis that treats acoustic receivers as network nodes and analyses movement between nodes. To investigate the utility of NA in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using acoustically monitored coastal sharks was conducted. To make direct comparisons with static traditional analysis a temporal scale was not explicitly explored. Comparison of traditional analysis and NA demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50% kernel utilization distribution (KUD) equivalent), but that NA tended to overestimate general use areas (95% KUD equivalent) compared to kernel-based methods. Furthermore, frequent bidirectional movements within core use areas were identified by NA, indicating the importance of movement corridors within or between core areas. Movements between acoustic receivers outside core use areas were less frequent and unidirectional suggesting transiting movements. Therefore, NA may be a practical alternative to traditional home range metrics by providing useful data interpretation that allows for a comprehensive picture of animal movement, including identifying core use areas and pathways used.

During the implementation of the State of California (USA) Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), which mandates the creation of an MPA network in California's state waters, the stakeholders and policymakers utilized a pair of economic analyses that addressed these considerations. One was a comparative, static assessment of short-term, ""worst case"" potential socioeconomic impacts to important fisheries based on surveys of local fishermen. This analysis made no assumptions about fishery management outside of MPAs, assumed no spillover of fish from MPAs into fished areas or reallocation of fishing effort, and estimated the maximum potential dollar-value economic impacts over a short time scale. The other was a dynamic, bioeconomic assessment of the changes in spatial distribution of biomass and catch, based on published biological parameter values, oceanographic models of larval connectivity, and a range of possible levels of fishing. This analysis explicitly accounted for fish population dynamics, spillover, fisher movement, and fishery management outside of the MPAs, but was limited to long-term, equilibrium-based results because of a lack of baseline abundance data. Both evaluation methods were novel in their spatial resolution and their use directly in an MPA design process, rather than after implementation. The two methods produced broadly similar (at a regional spatial scale) evaluations of the likely effects of proposed MPAs on fisheries, at least when the bioeconomic model assumed fishery management was conservative. Our experience with these analyses in the MLPA Initiative process led to several suggestions for future MPA design efforts: (i) since the change in fish biomass inside MPAs partly depends on fisheries management outside of them, it is useful to integrate or coordinate conventional fishery management and MPA planning efforts; (ii) integrate modeling assessments early into MPA design, as part of a post-implementation adaptive management approach; and (iii) integrate empirical fishery data into bioeconomic models in order to improve representations of human behavior and short-term forecasts of changes in fished populations.

Two types of external attachments (sutured to epidermis and backpack) and traditional implanting in the peritoneal cavity were tested between groups of 5 adult individuals of the crested newt Triturus cristatus (mass 6-15 g) held in terrariums under controlled environmental conditions. The newts were anaesthetized with 1.5 g l(-1) MS222, delivered in water and buffered to pH 6.9 by Na(2)CO(2). Surgical plane of anaesthesia was achieved after 5-12 minutes and lasted for 30-60 minutes. External tagging proved unsuitable because transmitters became entangled in vegetation, and all animals shed their transmitters shortly after tagging, except for one that died. Transmitters that were surgically implanted in the peritoneal cavity were more successful. By the fourth day following surgery, the animals that had undergone surgery behaved similarly to control animals with respect to the use of cover. Two of the newts died, however, without showing any signs of illness in advance, and the cause of death could not be established. Based on the present experiments and published studies, implantable transmitters appear to be the best method for radiotagging small and medium sized urodele species such as T. cristatus, to gain crucial information on spatio-temporal terrestrial activity patterns, habitat utilization and hibernation sites.

We examined two different methods to obtain suitable characteristics. First, a model based on the Gabor function was used to describe the dominant frequencies in a click, and then the model parameters were used as classification features. The Gabor function model was selected because it has been used to model dolphin sonar pulses with great precision. Additionally, it has the interesting property that it has an optimal time-frequency resolution. As such, it can indicate optimal usage ofthe sonar by sperm whales. Second, the clicks were expressed in a wavelet packet table, from which subsequently a local discriminant basis was created. A wavelet packet basis has the advantage that it offers a highly redundant number of coefficients, which allow signals to be represented it many different ways. From the redundant signal description a representation can be selected that emphasizes the differences between classes. This local discrimminant basis is more flexible than the Gabor function, which can make it more suitable for classification, but it is also more complex. Class vectors were created with both models and classification was based on the distance of a click to these vectors. We show that the Gabor Function could not model the sperm whale clicks very well, clue to the variability of the changing click characteristics. Best performance was reached when three subsequent clicks were averaged to smoothen the variability. Around 70% ofthe clicks classified correctly in both the training and validation sets. The wavelet packet table adapted better to the changing characteristics, and gave better classification. Here, also using a 3-click moving average, around 95% of the training sets classified correctly and 78% of the validation sets. These numbers lowered by only a few per cent when single clicks, instead of a moving average, were classified. This indicates that, while the features may show too Much variability to enable unique identification of individual whales on a click by click basis, the wavelet approach may be capable of distinguishing between a small group of whales.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,FEB,2007,101017S0025315407049508,"Univ Politecn Catalunya, Lab Aplicac Bioacust, Barcelona, Spain./Delft Univ Technol, Dept Stat, Delft, Netherlands./Delft Univ Technol, Informat Theory Grp, Delft, Netherlands./Univ Wales, Inst Environm Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.","Andre, M (reprint author), Univ Politecn Catalunya, Lab Aplicac Bioacust, Barcelona, Spain.",NA

disruption","Over evolutionary time, light from the sun, moon, and stars has provided organisms with reliable information about the passage of time; but modern artificial lighting has drastically altered these cues. Evidence is accumulating that exposure to light at night particularly blue wavelengths from computer screens, urban light pollution, or as an occupational hazard of night-shift work has major implications for human health. Nocturnal animals in zoos are generally housed on reversed light cycles and are illuminated by blue or red artificial light so that daytime visitors can observe their active behaviors. However, previous research suggests that exposure to light all 24h of the day and exposure to blue light during the dark phase can be harmful to human and animal health. Information about the consequences of lighting design for animal health and behavior is needed to formulate evidence-based guidelines for the exhibition of nocturnal animals in zoos. This study was conducted with nocturnal strepsirrhines at two facilities, one where the standard practice was to house nocturnal primates under blue light, and the other red. We experimentally changed the color of light illuminating habitats during the dark phase using an ABA study design and recorded continuous behavior data. We hypothesized that activity levels and time allocated to specific active behaviors would be lower under blue light compared to red. The overall percent of time spent performing active behaviors was lower when subjects were housed under blue light compared to red (generalized linear mixed models: pottos (N = 4), F-1,F-1169 = 54.0, p < 0.001; pygmy slow lorises (N = 2), F-1,F-689 = 26.4, p < 0.001; moholi bushbabies (N = 2), F-1,F-482 = 99. 1, p < 0.001; and aye-aye (N = 1), F-1,F-312 = 8.4, p = 0.005). These changes were largely due to increased time spent moving around exhibits and examining objects under red light. We were also able to measure concentrations of the timekeeping hormone melatonin in the saliva of the aye-aye and found that levels were significantly lower in blue light compared to red (F-1,F-85 = 18.0, p < 0.001). These results offer a compelling reason to reconsider the practice of exhibiting nocturnal animals under blue light, as wavelength-dependent suppression of behavior and hormones may have important implications for animal health and welfare.

In this study, sows of Minpig (n = 30, parity 2-8) and Landrace (n = 21, parity 2-8) were farrowed in individual pens with access to a yard. Sow behaviour was videotaped for 72 h in the second and third week after parturition. The results showed that the Minpig sows and Landrace sows were different in piglet-crushing behaviour (rolling, lying down from a sitting position or a standing position), lateral recumbency, ventral recumbency, and sitting and nursing behaviour (frequency of nutritive nursing and proportion of nursing terminated by the sow). The Minpig sows lie down at higher frequencies from a standing position, but crushing resulting from this movement in the Mm pig sows was much less common than in the Landrace sows with only 10 crushing incidents compared to 32, respectively. Crushing occurred most often when the sows changed from the ventral recumbency position to lateral recumbency. In the present study, the total number of occurrences of piglet crushing by the Minpig sows was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the Landrace ones (17 vs. 74). The results indicate that the Mm pig sows provided more chances for piglets to escape successfully when the piglets were trapped by her body, leading to 76.5% of the Minpig piglets successfully escaping compared to 18.9% of the Landrace piglets. To explore the reason behind the above results, the carefulness of the sows during standing-to-lying and the responsiveness of the sows to piglet distress calls were investigated. Compared with the Landrace breed, the Minpig sows scored higher in standing-to-lying carefulness (<(F)over bar>(Minpig) = 2.4994, (F) over bar (Landrace) = 2.1238, P<0.01) and higher in responsiveness to piglet distress calls (<(F)over bar>(Minpig) = 1.7343. (F) over bar (Landrace) = 0.294, P<0.001). In conclusion, the data suggest that the Minpig sows show stronger maternal instincts through their behavioural postures and their carefulness with piglets compared with the Landrace breed, and this difference may play an important role in the further exploitation of local breeds for the swine breeding program in China.

Recently developed animal-borne digital video or still cameras have made it possible to directly observe and estimate the prey richness of a foraging patch with simultaneously recorded diving profiles. Optimal foraging theory suggests that patch residence time should be affected both by the time it takes to travel to a prey patch and the richness of the patch. Therefore, diving profiles obtained by animal-borne depth and time instruments may be used to calculate a relative index of the richness of a prey patch used by diving animals in the water column. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the indices of prey richness estimated from both dive profiles and image data using adult female Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddelii at breeding colonies in Antarctica. There was a positive correlation between these 2 values, indicating that dive profiles can be used effectively to calculate a relative index of prey richness at a prey patch used by diving animals.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2005,103354meps295257,"Teikyo Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Anim Sci, Yamanashi 4090193, Japan./Univ Tokyo, Ocean Res Inst, Tokyo 1648639, Japan./Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo 1738515, Japan./Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.","Mori, Y (reprint author), Teikyo Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Anim Sci, 2525 Yatsuzawa, Yamanashi 4090193, Japan.",10_3354_meps295257

To investigate the seasonal movement patterns of adult yellow perch and how they are affected by lake habitat characteristics, we attached ultrasonic transmitters to two length-groups (210-235 and 250-280 mm total length) of yellow perch from populations inhabiting two temperate lakes differing in habitat diversity and basin morphology. In the simple lake, yellow perch distributions differed between seasons, mean depth and distance from shore being greatest during the summer. The observed seasonal differences were similar between the two length-groups. In the complex lake, yellow perch depth varied seasonally, the fish occupying deeper waters during the fall and shallower ones during the summer; however, the distance from shore was consistent among seasons. During the spring, males inhabited areas closer to shore than females in the complex lake, whereas the spatial distributions did not differ between sexes in the simple basin. Yellow perch from both lakes displayed similar seasonal variation in activity, movement rates being highest during the fall and lowest during the summer. Movement rates in the simple lake, however, were higher than those in the complex lake during all three seasons, which suggests that the effectiveness of passive sampling gears may vary in response to habitat complexity. These results reveal several seasonal differences in yellow perch habitat use, distribution, and activity in relation to basin complexity that may provide insight for managers considering sampling plans for individual lake types.",AMER FISHERIES SOC,FEB,2010,101577M082431,"[Radabaugh, Nicholas B.; Bauer, William F.; Brown, Michael L.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.","Radabaugh, NB (reprint author), Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Div Wildlife, 1500 Dublin Rd, Columbus, OH 43215 USA.",NA

Furthermore, retailers encourage delaying castration to exploit the superior growth rates of bulls compared with steers. Two experiments were conducted, under tropical conditions, comparing tension banding and surgical castration of weaner (7-10 months old) and mature (22-25 months old) Bos indicus bulls with and without pain management (ketoprofen or saline injected intramuscularly immediately prior to castration). Welfare outcomes were assessed using a wide range of measures; this paper reports on the behavioural responses of the bulls and an accompanying paper reports on other measures. Behavioural data were collected at intervals by direct observation and continuously via data loggers on the hind leg of the bulls to 4 weeks post-castration. Tension-banded bulls performed less movement in the crush/chute than the surgically castrated bulls during the procedures (weaner: 2.63 vs. 5.69, P < 0.001; mature: 1.00 vs. 5.94; P<0.001 for tension-band and surgical castration, respectively), indicating that tension banding was less painful then surgical castration during conduct. To 1.5 h post-castration, tension-banded bulls performed significantly (all P< 0.05) more active behavioural responses indicative of pain compared with surgical castrates, e.g., percentage time walking forwards (weaner: 15.0% vs. 8.1%; mature: 22.3% vs. 15.1%), walking backwards (weaner: 4.3% vs. 1.4%; mature: 2.4% vs. 0.5%), numbers of tail movements (weaner: 21.9 vs. 1.4; mature: 51.5 vs. 39.4) and leg movements (weaner: 12.9 vs. 0.9; mature: 8.5 vs. 1.5), respectively. In contrast, surgically castrated bulls performed more immobile behaviours compared with tension-banded bulls (e.g., standing in mature bulls was 56.6% vs. 34.4%, respectively, P=0.002). Ketoprofen administration appeared effective in moderating pain-related behaviours in the mature bulls from 1.5 to 3 h, e.g., reducing abnormal standing (0.0% vs. 7.7%, P=0.009) and increasing feeding (12.7% vs. 0.0%, P= 0.048) in NSAID- and saline-treated bulls, respectively. There were few behavioural differences subsequent to 24 h post-castration, but some limited evidence of chronic pain (3-4 weeks post-castration) with both methods. Interpretation, however, was difficult from behaviours alone. Thus, tension banding is less painful than surgical castration during conduct of the procedures and pain-related behavioural responses differ with castration method (active restlessness in response to tension banding and minimisation of movement in response to surgical castration). Ketoprofen administered immediately prior to castration was somewhat effective in reducing pain, particularly in the mature bulls. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Finding the best predictive model in this problem while considering different sources of heterogeneities can be very difficult to analyze theoretically, which stresses the need of an experimental study. Therefore, in this paper, we first create the most complete dataset, focusing on accelerometer sensors, with various sources of heterogeneities. We then conduct an extensive analysis on feature representations and classification techniques (the most comprehensive comparison yet with 293 classifiers) for activity recognition. Principal component analysis is applied to reduce the feature vector dimension while keeping essential information. The average classification accuracy of eight sensor positions is reported to be 96.44% +/- 1.62% with 10-fold evaluation, whereas accuracy of 79.92% +/- 9.68% is reached in the subject-independent evaluation.

Currently, much about the mechanism underlying sonar-based navigation in bats remains unknown, and no computational models of this ability have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a computational model of sonar-based navigation in bats. In particular, we advance a model explaining how bats could assemble a cognitive map from their environment using only their sonar readings. The model consists of two loops. The first loop performs low-level obstacle avoidance. This gives rise to stable and environment-derived flight corridors (i.e. preferred pathways for bats flying through the environment). The second high-level loop runs on top of the low-level loop and performs mapping. Mapping is done by combining local view information extracted from echo signals with local self-motion information to recognize previously visited places and memorize their spatial relationships. Using this model, we simulate a bat exploring unstructured environments while constructing a cognitive map using a biologically plausible algorithm. The model we propose allows the simulated bat to construct a global map of its flight paths through the environment without the bat ever reconstructing the three-dimensional layout of the local environment from any of its received echo signals. Indeed, neither the obstacle avoidance strategy that guides the bat through space nor the mapping algorithm requires the three-dimensional geometric structure of the environment to be accessible to the bat.

SPEED; ORIENTATION; SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION; DATA STORAGE (ARCHIVAL) TAGS","A quantitative model has been developed which predicts geographical movements of demersal fish on the European continental shelf by combining tidal stream vectors calculated from Admiralty tidal data with known patterns of fish behaviour. The model interpolates the speed and direction of the tidal current at any specified position and allows for the cyclical change of current speed between neap and spring tides. Fish behaviour is specified in terms of swimming speed and direction, as well as times of vertical migration and the duration of the intervening period in midwater. Times of vertical migration to and from the bottom can be specified theoretically in relation to regular tidal events (slackwater, high or low tide, etc.), or practically using actual observations made by sonar or data storage (archival) lags. Simulated tracks can be used singly to predict the behaviour of individual fish in relation to biological problems, or collectively to predict the distribution of whole populations in relation to management problems. These predictions can be formulated so that they can be tested experimentally. The model is being used to reconstruct the ground tracks of fish fitted with data storage (archival) tags and also to predict the theoretical movements of individuals and populations. It has been validated by reconstructing the ground tracks of fish tracked in the open sea using sector scanning sonar and transponding acoustic tags. Potential applications include estimating transfer coefficients for use in spatial assessment models, assessing the exchange of fish between fishable areas and areas closed to fishing for conservation reasons, and providing a theoretical framework for analysing returns from conventional fish tagging experiments.

This is the source-sink paradox. Animals appear to be choosing habitat that will lower their fitness. It is argued that the paradox can be resolved by considering individual decisions in a conditional choice model with non-identical individuals that differ in competitive ability and current expected reproductive output. Individuals that are more mature, healthier, and/or arrive earlier to the source will acquire territory at lower cost and will defend it more vigorously and effectively. For other individuals, costs (including running out of time for breeding) of acquiring territory in the source become so high that moving to the sink increases their fitness. The model is implemented in an individual-based modeling framework. The cost-benefit decision model unites previously disparate topics into a single framework, including protandry, territoriality, philopatry, and juvenile dispersal. Simulation results and a literature survey support predictions. Results indicate that individuals with lower competitive ability (e.g., juveniles) obtain a fitness advantage from moving to a sink. Random sorting of individuals (simple pre-emption) results in lower population lambda than competitive sorting. The effective population lambda in the source is increased and in the sink is decreased by competitive sorting such that individual and population lambda are not simple functions of habitat quality. The theory and models developed link individual behaviours to population processes and resolve the source-sink paradox. It is suggested that metapopulation modeling theory needs to be revisited based on the results presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Various analytic techniques, including but not limited to random walks, Brownian motion models, and step selection functions have been used for modeling movement. These fall under the rubric of signal models which are divided into deterministic and stochastic models. The difficulty of applying these models to the movement of dynamic objects (e.g. animals, humans, vehicles) is that the spatiotemporal signal produced by their trajectories a complex composite that is influenced by the Geography through which they move (i.e. the network or the physiography of the terrain), their behavioral state (i.e. hungry, going to work, shopping, tourism, etc.), and their interactions with other individuals.

In this research, we propose a stochastic simulation model that incorporates contextual factors (i.e. environmental conditions) that affect local choices along its movement trajectory.

We extend a model of ideally motivated populations to describe the local and regional consequences of interactions between three populations distinguished by their levels of cooperation and exploitation. Inspired by the classic prisoner's dilemma game, stereotypical fitness functions describe a baseline non-cooperative population whose per capita fitness decreases with density, obligate co-operators who initially benefit from the presence of conspecifics, and kleptoparasites who require heterospecifics to extract resources from the environment. We examine these populations in multiple combinations, determine where both local and regional coexistence is permitted, and investigate conditions under which one population will invade another. When they invade co-operators in resource-rich areas, kleptoparasites initiate a dynamic instability that leads to the loss of both populations; however, selfish hosts, who can persist at low densities, are immune to this risk. Furthermore, adaptive movement may delay the onset of instability as dispersal relieves dynamic stress. Selfish and cooperative populations default to mutual exclusion, but asymmetric variations in interference strength may relax this condition and permit limited sympatry within the environment. Distinct sub-communities characterize the overall spatial structure.",ROYAL SOC,NOV,2016,101098rsos160788,"[Reding, Ilona] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, NC USA./[Kelley, Michael] Appalachian State Univ, Boone, NC 28608 USA./[Rowell, Jonathan T.; Rychtar, Jan] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.","Rowell, JT (reprint author), Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA.",5180165

It is shown that the widely used minimum convex polygon has some undesirable characteristics as an estimator, and thus should be used with caution. A method based on convex hull peeling of the data to estimate convex density contours is studied as an alternative simple home-range size estimator. Monte Carlo simulations show that this estimator has very similar statistical properties if the point fixes are generated from a bivariate normal distribution, a uniform on a disc distribution, and two other distributions with intermediate tail behaviour. These standard distributions are used as a reference to define a sample size bias-corrected estimator of home-range size, and to provide an approximate method for calculating the precision of this estimator. The technique is applied to the estimation of the home-range sizes of deer.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,DEC,1995,1023072533254,NA,"Worton, BJ (reprint author), UNIV ESSEX, DEPT MATH, WIVENHOE PK, COLCHESTER CO4 3SQ, ESSEX, ENGLAND.",NA

Generally, such chemicals derive from the female reproductive organs or cells. Exceptionally, squid spermatozoa mutually release and perceive carbon dioxide to form clusters after ejaculation. We previously identified the pH-taxis by which each spermatozoon can execute a sharp turn, but how flagellar dynamics enable this movement remains unknown. Here, we show that initiation of the turn motion requires a swim down a steep proton gradient (a theoretical estimation of >= 0.025 pH/s), crossing a threshold pH value of similar to 5.5. Time- resolved kinematic analysis revealed that the turn sequence results from the rhythmic exercise of two flagellar motions: a stereotypical flagellar 'bent-cane' shape followed by asymmetric wave propagation, which enables a sharp turn in the realm of low Reynolds numbers. This turning episode is terminated by an 'overshoot' trajectory that differs from either straight-line motility or turning. As with bidirectional pH-taxes in some bacteria, squid spermatozoa also showed repulsion from strong acid conditions with similar flagellar kinematics as in positive pH-taxis. These findings indicate that squid spermatozoa might have a unique reorientation mechanism, which could be dissimilar to that of classical egg-guided sperm chemotaxis in other marine invertebrates.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,OCT 11,2017,101038s4159801713406z,"[Iida, Tomohiro; Hirohashi, Noritaka] Shimane Univ, Educ & Res Ctr Biol Resources, Oki Marine Biol Stn, 194 Kamo,Okinoshima Cho, Oki, Shimane 6850024, Japan./[Iwata, Yoko] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan./[Mohri, Tatsuma] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Sect Individual Res, 5-1 Higashiyama,Myodaiji Cho, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan./[Baba, Shoji A.] Ochanomizu Univ, 2-2-1 Otsuka, Tokyo 1128610, Japan.","Hirohashi, N (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Educ & Res Ctr Biol Resources, Oki Marine Biol Stn, 194 Kamo,Okinoshima Cho, Oki, Shimane 6850024, Japan.",10_1038_s41598_017_13406_z

Wildlife scientists continue to be interested in studying ways to quantify how the movements of animals are interdependent - dynamic interaction. While a number of applied studies of dynamic interaction exist, little is known about the comparative effectiveness and applicability of available methods used for quantifying interactions between animals.
2. We highlight the formulation, implementation and interpretation of a suite of eight currently available indices of dynamic interaction. Point-and path-based approaches are contrasted to demonstrate differences between methods and underlying assumptions on telemetry data.
3. Correlated and biased correlated random walks were simulated at a range of sampling resolutions to generate scenarios with dynamic interaction present and absent. We evaluate the effectiveness of each index at identifying different types of interactive behaviour at each sampling resolution. Each index is then applied to an empirical telemetry data set of three whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) dyads.
4. Results from the simulated data show that three indices of dynamic interaction reliant on statistical testing procedures are susceptible to Type I error, which increases at fine sampling resolutions. In the white-tailed deer examples, a recently developed index for quantifying local-level cohesive movement behaviour (the di index) provides revealing information on the presence of infrequent and varying interactions in space and time.
5. Point-based approaches implemented with finely sampled telemetry data overestimate the presence of interactions (Type I errors). Indices producing only a single global statistic (7 of the 8 indices) are unable to quantify infrequent and varying interactions through time. The quantification of infrequent and variable interactive behaviour has important implications for the spread of disease and the prevalence of social behaviour in wildlife. Guidelines are presented to inform researchers wishing to study dynamic interaction patterns in their own telemetry data sets. Finally, we make our code openly available, in the statistical software R, for computing each index of dynamic interaction presented herein.",WILEY,SEP,2014,1.01111136526561E+018,"[Long, Jed A.] Univ St Andrews, Ctr GeoInformat, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland./[Nelson, Trisalyn A.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Spatial Pattern Anal & Res Lab, Victoria, BC, Canada./[Webb, Stephen L.; Gee, Kenneth L.] Samuel Roberts Noble Fdn Inc, Ardmore, OK 73401 USA.","Long, JA (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, Ctr GeoInformat, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",NA

In this article, (1) environmental factors affecting the migration behaviour and survival of smolts and post-smolts during the river, estuarine and early marine phases, (2) how behavioural patterns are linked to survival and (3) how anthropogenic factors affect migration and survival are synthesized and reviewed based on published literature. The timing of the smolt migration is important in determining marine survival. The timing varies among rivers, most likely as a consequence of local adaptations, to ensure sea entry during optimal periods. Smolts and post-smolts swim actively and fast during migration, but in areas with strong currents, their own movements may be overridden by current-induced transport. Progression rates during the early marine migration vary between 0.4 and 3.0 body lengths s-1 relative to the ground. Reported mortality is 0.37.0% (median 2.3) km-1 during downriver migration, 0.636% (median 6.0) km-1 in estuaries and 0.33.4% (median 1.4) km-1 in coastal areas. Estuaries and river mouths are the sites of the highest mortalities, with predation being a common cause. The mortality rates varied more among studies in estuaries than in rivers and marine areas, which probably reflects the huge variation among estuaries in their characteristics. Behaviour and survival during migration may also be affected by pollution, fish farming, sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis, hydropower development and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal, delay migration or have indirect effects by inhibiting migration. Total mortality reported during early marine migration (up to 5230 km from the river mouths) in the studies available to date varies between 8 and 71%. Hence, the early marine migration is a life stage with high mortalities, due to both natural and human influences. Factors affecting mortality during the smolt and post-smolt stages contribute to determine the abundance of spawner returns. With many S. salar populations in decline, increased mortality at these stages may considerably contribute to limit S. salar production, and the consequences of human-induced mortality at this stage may be severe. Development of management actions to increase survival and fitness at the smolt and post-smolt stages is crucial to re-establish or conserve wild populations.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUL,2012,101111j10958649201203370x,"[Thorstad, E.

As a result, the migratory behaviour and associated survival estimates of salmon in real time are not known. Major information gaps also exist in terms of stock-specific marine behaviour and survival-especially as they relate to recent changes in climate. Acoustic telemetry and other modern tools enable researchers to answer specific questions about environmental, physiological, and genetic effects on individual salmon survival and behaviour, which had not been possible previously.

A series of complex statistical tools have been developed in conjunction with this increase in data. Each of these methods offers certain improvements over previously proposed methods, but each has certain assumptions or shortcomings that make its general application difficult. In the case of the recently developed Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) method, the subjectivity in parameter selection serves as one of the primary impediments to its more widespread use. While there are certain advantages to the flexibility it offers for question-driven research, the lack of an objective approach for parameter selection may prevent some users from exploring the benefits of the method.
Methods: Here we present a cross-validation-based approach for selecting parameter values to optimize the T-LoCoH algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of the approach using a case study from the Etosha National Park anthrax system.
Results: Utilizing the proposed algorithm, rather than the guidelines in the T-LoCoH documentation, results in significantly different values for derived site fidelity metrics.
Conclusions: Due to its basis in principles of cross-validation, the application of this method offers a more objective approach than the relatively subjective guidelines set forth in the T-LoCoH documentation and enables a more accurate basis for the comparison of home ranges among individuals and species, as well as among studies.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,SEP 6,2017,101186s4046201701104,"[Dougherty, Eric R.; Carlson, Colin J.; Getz, Wayne M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Blackburn, Jason K.] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Spatial Epidemiol & Ecol Res Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA./[Blackburn, Jason K.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA./[Getz, Wayne M.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Sci, Durban, South Africa.","Dougherty, ER (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",10_1186_s40462_017_0110_4

First, a trajectory is partitioned into a set of sub-trajectories using the movement characteristic points. In this process, GPS points indicate that the motion status of the vehicle has transformed from one state into another, and are regarded as the movement characteristic points. Then, GPS data are cleaned based on the similarities of GPS points and the movement consistency model of the sub-trajectory. The movement consistency model is built using the random sample consensus algorithm based on the high spatial consistency of high-quality GPS data.

Second, interpersonal ties between migrants and would-be migrants form a self-perpetuating system, which adapts in ways that are difficult to observe or predict. Third, empirical evaluations of immigration policy are vulnerable to endogeneity and other issues of causal inference. In this paper, we pair tailor-made empirical designs with an agent-based computational model (ABM) to capture the dynamics of a migration system that often elude empirical analysis, while grounding agent rules and characteristics with primary data collected in Jamaica, an origin country. We find that some government-imposed restrictions on migrants can deter total migration, but others are ineffective. Relative to a system of free movement, the minimal eligibility conditions required to classify migrants into visa categories alone make migration inaccessible for many. Restrictive policies imposed on student and high-skilled visa categories have little added effect because eligible individuals are likely able to migrate through alternative legal categories. Meanwhile, restrictions on family-based visas result in significant reductions in total migration.

Rowan, Andrew",NA,NA,NA,"Simple Summary: Over the past ten years, unprecedented changes in the way farm animals are kept on intensive production facilities have begun to take hold in the U.S. veal, egg and pork industries. Propelled by growing public support for animal welfare, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has successfully led the effort to transition farms from using restrictive cages and crates to more open aviary and group housing systems that offer the animals far more freedom to express natural behavior. This paper describes the background history of the movement, the strategy and approach of the campaign and the challenges that were overcome to enable this major shift in farming practices. The events chronicled are set within the context of the larger societal concern for animals and the important contributions of other animal protection organizations.
Abstract: In this paper, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) farm animal protection work over the preceding decade is described from the perspective of the organization. Prior to 2002, there were few legal protections for animals on the farm, and in 2005, a new campaign at the HSUS began to advance state ballot initiatives throughout the country, with a decisive advancement in California (Proposition 2) that paved the way for further progress. Combining legislative work with undercover farm and slaughterhouse investigations, litigation and corporate engagement, the HSUS and fellow animal protection organizations have made substantial progress in transitioning the veal, pork and egg industries away from intensive confinement systems that keep the animals in cages and crates. Investigations have become an important tool for demonstrating widespread inhumane practices, building public support and convincing the retail sector to publish meaningful animal welfare policies. While federal legislation protecting animals on the farm stalled, there has been steady state-by-state progress, and this is complemented by major brands such as McDonald's and Walmart pledging to purchase only from suppliers using cage-free and crate-free animal housing systems. The evolution of societal expectations regarding animals has helped propel the recent wave of progress and may also be driven, in part, by the work of animal protection organizations.",NA,MAY,2017,103390ani7050040,NA,NA,5447922

A Kalman filter is applied to reduce the measurement noise from the vital signal. An algorithm is presented to separate the heart rate signal from the breathing harmonics. An auto-correlation based technique is applied for detecting random body movements (RBM) during the measurement process. Experiments were performed in different scenarios in order to show the validity of the algorithm. The vital signs were estimated for the signal reflected from the chest, as well as from the back side of the body in different experiments.

Therefore, methods for bias-correction must be validated for the region to which they will be applied. Our objectives were to quantify factors affecting detection probability of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) during helicopter surveys in Texas, USA, rangelands, and develop a detection probability model to reduce bias in deer population estimates. We placed global positioning system (GPS) collars on 215 deer on 6 sites representative of mule deer range in the southern Great Plains and the Chihuahuan Desert during 2008-2010. We collected data during aerial surveys in January-March and fit logistic regression models to predict detection probability of mule deer based on ecological and behavioral covariates. We evaluated the model using independent estimates of population size derived from a mark-resight procedure. Detection of mule deer was negatively related to distance from the transect, increasing brush cover, sunlight, and increasing terrain ruggedness (P< 0.01). Probability of detection in brush cover was greater if deer were active (P = 0.02). Population estimates corrected for visibility bias using our detection probability model or mark-resight models averaged 2.1 +/- 0.49 (SD; n = 50) and 2.2 +/- 0.62 times larger, respectively, than uncorrected counts. Estimates of population size derived from the detection probability model averaged 101 +/- 26% of mark-resight estimates. However, the detection probability model did not improve precision of population estimates, probably because of unmodeled variation in availability of deer during surveys.

The model consists of a system of partial differential equations whose parameters reflect the movement behavior of individuals within each pack and whose steady-state solutions describe the patterns of space-use associated to each pack. By controlling the behavioral parameters in a spatially-dynamic fashion, packs adjust their patterns of movement so as to find a Nash-optimal balance between spreading their territory and avoiding conflict with hostile neighbors. On the mathematical side, we show that solving a nonzero-sum differential game corresponds to finding a non-invasible function-valued trait.

We describe population heterogeneity in a state-structured framework, employing advection-diffusion as the fundamental movement process of individuals occupying different movement states. Our general analysis shows that population heterogeneity in movement behavior can be defined as the existence of different movement states and among-individual variability in the time individuals spend in these states. A presentation of moment-based metrics of movement illustrates the role of these attributes in general dispersal processes. We also present a special case of the general theory: a model population composed of individuals occupying one of two movement states with linear transitions, or exchange, between the two states. This two-state ""exchange model"" can be viewed as a correlated random walk and provides a generalization of the telegraph equation. By exploiting the main result of our general analysis, we characterize the exchange model by deriving moment-based metrics of its movement process and identifying an analytical representation of the model's time-dependent solution.

By tracking the individual migrations of Atlantic Puffins, Fratercula arctica, in successive years using geolocators, we describe migratory behaviour in a pelagic seabird that is apparently incompatible with this view. Puffins do not migrate to a single overwintering area, but follow a dispersive pattern of movements changing through the non-breeding period, showing great variability in travel distances and directions. Despite this within-population variability, individuals show remarkable consistency in their own migratory routes among years. This combination of complex population dispersion and individual route fidelity cannot easily be accounted for in terms of genetic inheritance of compass instructions, or cultural inheritance of traditional routes.

However, it has been suggested that echolocation calls may also have a communicative function, for instance between roost members. In principle, this seems possible because echolocation calls are species specific and known to differ between the sexes, and between colonies and individuals for some species. We performed playback experiments with lesser bulldog bats, Noctilio albiventris, to which we presented calls of familiar/unfamiliar conspecifics, cohabitant/noncohabitant heterospecifics and ultrasonic white noise as a control. Bats reacted with a complex repertoire of social behaviours and the intensity of their response differed significantly between stimulus categories. Stronger reactions were shown towards echolocation calls of unfamiliar conspecifics than towards heterospecifics and white noise. To our knowledge, this is the first time that bats have been found to react to echolocation calls with a suite of social behaviours. Our results also provide the first experimental evidence for acoustical differentiation by bats between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, and of heterospecifics. Analysis of echolocation calls confirmed significant individual differences between echolocation calls. In addition, we found a nonsignificant trend towards group signatures in echolocation calls of N. albiventris. We suggest that echolocation calls used during orientation may also communicate species identity, group affiliation and individual identity. Our study highlights the communicative potential of sonar signals that have previously been categorized as cues in animal social systems. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The recently developed Brownian bridge movement model (BBMM) has advantages over traditional methods because it quantifies the utilization distribution of an animal based on its movement path rather than individual points and accounts for temporal autocorrelation and high data volumes. However, the BBMM assumes unrealistic homogeneous movement behaviour across all data. 2. Accurate quantification of the utilization distribution is important for identifying the way animals use the landscape. 3. We improve the BBMM by allowing for changes in behaviour, using likelihood statistics to determine change points along the animal's movement path. 4. This novel extension, outperforms the current BBMM as indicated by simulations and examples of a territorial mammal and a migratory bird. The unique ability of our model to work with tracks that are not sampled regularly is especially important for GPS tags that have frequent failed fixes or dynamic sampling schedules. Moreover, our model extension provides a useful one-dimensional measure of behavioural change along animal tracks. 5.

Some studies have attempted this using three-dimensional models, like robots. Our goal was to assess the foraging and scanning behaviour of adult house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, in response to robots mimicking different types of behaviours in artificial flocks (three linearly placed enclosures, with robots at the periphery and a live animal at the centre). We recorded whether live animals reacted to (1) the presence/absence of robots, (2) the motion of robots in relation to static robots, (3) variations in the type of robot behaviour and (4) the direction of the responses (increasing or decreasing their foraging effort). Adult house finches reacted differently to the presence, motion and behaviour of robots, and they spent more time foraging and less time scanning, which led to increasing seed intake, as the robots simulated body movement that could be associated with successful foraging behaviour (more handling time) or antipredator behaviour. Responses to robots were similar to those given to live conspecifics. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of using robots in social foraging research and conclude that robots are suitable to test some hypotheses on the foraging and antipredator behaviour of flocks.

Management measures designed to reduce bycatch often result in significant economic losses and even fisheries closures. Static spatial management approaches can also be rendered ineffective by environmental variability and climate change, as productive habitats shift and introduce new interactions between human activities and protected species. We introduce a new multispecies and dynamic approach that uses daily satellite data to track ocean features and aligns scales of management, species movement, and fisheries. To accomplish this, we create species distribution models for one target species and three bycatch-sensitive species using both satellite telemetry and fisheries observer data. We then integrate species-specific probabilities of occurrence into a single predictive surface, weighing the contribution of each species by management concern. We find that dynamic closures could be 2 to 10 times smaller than existing static closures while still providing adequate protection of endangered nontarget species. Our results highlight the opportunity to implement near real-time management strategies that would both support economically viable fisheries and meet mandated conservation objectives in the face of changing ocean conditions.

In tennis, the unceasing to-and-fro displacements of a player about a ""home"" reference position, located in the middle of the baseline, are akin to those of an oscillator, and the reciprocal attending of both players establishes an informational linkage. Thus, theoretically, the displacement of the two players can be analysed as a system formed by two coupled non-linear oscillators. In such a system, relative phase has been shown to be an adept measure of the temporal synchronization between the oscillators. We hypothesized that relative phase is a relevant collective variable to characterize the relative motion of tennis players. Four players were videotaped and their displacements analysed. The results revealed just two stable patterns of synchronization, in-phase and anti-phase, as the players moved in the same or opposite directions, respectively. Moreover, relative phase showed two types of evolution within trials: either it remained stable at in-phase or anti-phase, or it exhibited transitions between these two modes. In accordance with our hypothesis, the results identified relative phase as a pertinent collective variable to represent both invariance and change in the relative displacements of tennis players. Such a finding opens new avenues for investigating dual sports.",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,OCT,2005,1.01080026404104E+022,"Univ Toulouse 3, UFR STAPS, LAPMA, F-31062 Toulouse, France.","Palut, Y (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 3, UFR STAPS, LAPMA, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.",NA

Many species rely on behavioral thermoregulation and move within their landscape to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the fine-scale nature of this regulation through tracking techniques can provide a better understanding of the relationships between such species and their dynamic environments. The use of animal tracking and telemetry technology has allowed the extensive collection of such data which has enabled us to better understand the ways animals move within their landscape. However, such technologies do not come without certain costs: they are generally invasive, relatively expensive, can be too heavy for small sized animals and unreliable in certain habitats. This study provides a cost-effective and non-invasive method through photo-identification, to determine fine scale movements of individuals. With our methodology, we have been able to find that male eastern water dragons (Intellagama leuseurii) have home ranges one and a half times larger than those of females. Furthermore, we found intraspecific differences in the size of home ranges depending on the time of the day. Lastly, we found that location mostly influenced females' home ranges, but not males and discuss why this may be so.

A faster escape does not enhance survival in zebrafish larvae,2098,"Nair, Arjun
Nguyen, Christy
McHenry, Matthew J.",NA,NA,NA,"An escape response is a rapid manoeuvre used by prey to evade predators. Performing this manoeuvre at greater speed, in a favourable direction, or from a longer distance have been hypothesized to enhance the survival of prey, but these ideas are difficult to test experimentally. We examined how prey survival depends on escape kinematics through a novel combination of experimentation and mathematical modelling. This approach focused on zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae under predation by adults and juveniles of the same species. High-speed three-dimensional kinematics were used to track the body position of prey and predator and to determine the probability of behavioural actions by both fish. These measurements provided the basis for an agent-based probabilistic model that simulated the trajectories of the animals. Predictions of survivorship by this model were found by Monte Carlo simulations to agree with our observations and we examined how these predictions varied by changing individual model parameters. Contrary to expectation, we found that survival may not be improved by increasing the speed or altering the direction of the escape. Rather, zebrafish larvae operate with sufficiently high locomotor performance due to the relatively slow approach and limited range of suction feeding by fish predators. We did find that survival was enhanced when prey responded from a greater distance. This is an ability that depends on the capacity of the visual and lateral line systems to detect a looming threat. Therefore, performance in sensing, and not locomotion, is decisive for improving the survival of larval fish prey. These results offer a framework for understanding the evolution of predator-prey strategy that may inform prey survival in a broad diversity of animals.",NA,APR 12,2017,101098rspb20170359,NA,NA,NA
"A few long versus many short foraging trips: different foraging
strategies of lesser kestrel sexes during breeding",2081,"Hernandez-Pliego, Jesus
Rodriguez, Carlos
Bustamante, Javier",NA,NA,NA,"Background: In species with biparental care both members of the breeding pair cooperate to raise the offspring either by assisting each other in every reproductive task or by specializing in different ones. The latter case is known as reproductive role specialization. Raptors are considered one of the most role-specialized groups, but little is known about parental behavior away from the nest. Until the advent of biologgers, avian role specialization was traditionally studied with direct observations at the nest because of the difficulties of following and recording the behavior of free-ranging individuals. In this paper we analyze how the role specialization of the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) influences foraging movement patterns throughout the breeding season. We tracked 30 lesser kestrel breeders from two breeding colonies using high-frequency GPS-dataloggers during four consecutive breeding seasons.
Results: We found no differences between sexes in lesser kestrel foraging movements early in the breeding season before the formation of the breeding pair. However, we observed sexually distinct foraging movement strategies later in the breeding season once breeding pairs were formed. Lesser kestrel males performed a large number of short foraging trips while females made a few long ones. This maximized the provisioning rate by males to feed their mates and offspring. Meanwhile, lesser kestrel females spent more time at the colony than males in order to defend the nest, incubate the eggs and brood the nestlings. Females also helped their mates to provision the nestling once these had grown and required more food and less protection. Furthermore, lesser kestrels showed a sexual spatial segregation in foraging areas, with males foraging closer to the colony than females.
Conclusions: The lesser kestrel responds to changes in energy demand throughout the breeding season with its foraging movement strategy, but in a different way depending on parental sex. The sexual spatial segregation observed is likely to be the result of an adaptive foraging strategy based on role specialization to reduce prey depletion close to the colony and intersexual competition in order to improve breeding success.",NA,APR 25,2017,101186s4046201701006,NA,NA,10_1186_s40462_017_0100_6

In seabirds, several long-range foragers have been shown to alternate long and short trips to balance these dual needs. However, the strategies of short-range foragers remain poorly understood. We used a precise, miniaturized motion sensor to examine the time budget of 20 breeding Cape gannets, Morus capensis, foraging off the coast of South Africa. Birds stayed at sea for 5.5-25.3 h, occasionally spending the night at sea. The large number of isolated dives and extended flight time observed during these overnight trips suggested that birds either experienced poor foraging conditions or exploited more distant, yet more profitable prey patches. Conversely, birds that stayed at sea for less than 1 day had relatively consistent activity patterns. Most of these birds (88%) foraged actively at the beginning and at the end of the foraging trip. These feeding bouts were separated by protracted periods of sitting on the sea surface. Such resting periods probably allow birds to digest the food ingested during the first part of the foraging trip, so they initially feed themselves, and then obtain food for their chick on the way back to the breeding site.

Here we test the method for the first time in a humid tropical forest habitat on 14 herpetofaunal species. We found thread bobbins to be effective for large anurans (one leptodactylid and one bufonid), medium-large terrestrial snakes (one boid, three colubrids and one viperid), and testudines (one chelid), but largely unsuccessful for arboreal snakes (one boid and one colubrid), small and slender snakes (two colubrids), and small anurans (one strabomantid).

The thread trail revealed the exact movements of the tracked animal, providing detailed information on activity and microhabitat use that many alternative tracking methods cannot provide. Conservation projects rely heavily upon understanding the life history of species and without this prior knowledge, conservation efforts can fail, wasting funds and resources.

In this study we dart-tagged snapper (Pagrus auratus), an important fishery species, across different areas and habitats in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. Tag returns were used to quantify movement behaviour and extraction rates using a maximum likelihood model that corrected for spatial variability in population size and fishing effort. Residency was high (similar to 90%) in two strata and lower (75%) in the remaining stratum. The stratum with the highest residency also appeared to experience the highest extraction rate (likely due to a lower population size). These results confirm the existence of differences in movement behaviour within the snapper population, suggesting that localized areas may become depleted regardless of the status of the overall stock. This has consequences for the scale of fisheries management and the size of marine reserves implemented in different regions. Understanding why variation in movement behaviour exists (i.e., genetic vs. environmental) is the next step in addressing the influence of animal behaviour on fisheries management.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",APR,2011,101139F11005,"[Parsons, Darren M.; Morrison, Mark A.; McKenzie, Jeremy R.; Hartill, Bruce W.; Bian, Richard] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Auckland, New Zealand./[Francis, R.

We tested this assumption by developing a flexible conceptual approach that does not assume, but allows for, the presence of discrete movement corridors. We quantified functional connectivity habitat for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across a large landscape in central western North America. We assigned sample locations to a movement state (encamped, traveling and relocating), and used Global Positioning System (GPS) location data and conditional logistic regression to estimate state-specific resource selection functions. Patterns of resource selection during different movement states reflected selection for sagebrush and general avoidance of rough topography and anthropogenic features. Distinct connectivity corridors were not common in the 5,625 km(2) study area. Rather, broad areas functioned as generally high or low quality connectivity habitat. A comprehensive map predicting the quality of connectivity habitat across the study area validated well based on a set of GPS locations from independent greater sage-grouse. The functional relationship between greater sage-grouse and the landscape did not always conform to the idea of a discrete corridor. A more flexible consideration of landscape connectivity may improve the efficacy of management actions by aligning those actions with the spatial patterns by which animals interact with the landscape.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,DEC 13,2013,101371journalpone0082271,"[Harju, Seth M.; Olson, Chad V.; Dzialak, Matthew R.; Mudd, James P.; Winstead, Jeff B.] Hayden Wing Associates LLC, Nat Resource Consultants, Laramie, WY USA.","Harju, SM (reprint author), Hayden Wing Associates LLC, Nat Resource Consultants, Laramie, WY USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0082271

An optimal tracking system should be lightweight, measure three-dimensional locations, enable flexible measurement schemes, transmit data remotely and measure environmental variables and biological parameters of the individual. Giving full consideration to the traits of birds and the constraints of technology, we have developed a GPS tracking system that attempts to achieve most of the aspirations of an optimal tracking system for free ranging birds without the need to recapture them. Here, we describe the design, performance and limitations of the system. We also present measurements on the tracked Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus to show how such a system can generate new opportunities for research at multiple scales. The GPS tracker weighs 12 g and includes a GPS receiver, micro-processor, 4 MB of memory for data storage, solar panel and battery. It has a tri-axial accelerometer to monitor behaviour. To maximize flexibility, it is equipped with a radio transceiver for bidirectional communication with a ground-based antenna network, which enables data to be downloaded and new measurement schemes to be uploaded remotely. The system facilitates a multi-scale approach to studying bird movement, from fine-scale movements (3-s measurement intervals) to long-distance migratory movements (intervals of 20-30 min) of the same individual. We anticipate that flexible tracking systems that enable researchers to optimize their measurement protocols will contribute to revolutionizing research on animal behaviour and ecology in the next decade.",SPRINGER,APR,2013,101007s1033601209081,"[Bouten, Willem; Shamoun-Baranes, Judy] Univ Amsterdam, IBED, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands./[Baaij, Edwin W.] Univ Amsterdam, Ctr Technol, Fac Sci, NL-1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands./[Camphuysen, Kees C.

This package consisted of a microsphere-resin float, very high frequency (VHF) transmitter, and galvanic timed release (GTR) device which allowed acceleration data logger (ADL) tags to remain on free-living sharks for several days before detaching from the fin. Upon release, tags floated to the surface and were located using a VHF receiver and yagi antenna. This method has been used successfully on blacktip, bull, nurse, and white sharks to produce an overall recovery rate of 95.7% on 47 deployments over periods of 1-111 h and shark displacement distances up to 35 km.

Full or partial barriers are especially problematic for migratory species whose life histories hinge on habitat connectivity.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The Hood Canal Bridge, a floating structure spanning the northern outlet of Hood Canal in Puget Sound, Washington, extends 3.6 meters underwater and forms a partial barrier for steelhead migrating from Hood Canal to the Pacific Ocean. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor migration behavior and mortality of steelhead smolts passing four receiver arrays and several single receivers within the Hood Canal, Puget Sound, and Strait of Juan de Fuca. Twenty-seven mortality events were detected within the vicinity of the Hood Canal Bridge, while only one mortality was recorded on the other 325 receivers deployed throughout the study area. Migrating steelhead smolts were detected at the Hood Canal Bridge array with greater frequency, on more receivers, and for longer durations than smolts migrating past three comparably configured arrays. Longer migration times and paths are likely to result in a higher density of smolts near the bridge in relation to other sites along the migration route, possibly inducing an aggregative predator response to steelhead smolts.
Conclusions/Significance: This study provides strong evidence of substantial migration interference and increased mortality risk associated with the Hood Canal Bridge, and may partially explain low early marine survival rates observed in Hood Canal steelhead populations. Understanding where habitat modifications indirectly increase predation pressures on threatened populations helps inform potential approaches to mitigation.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SEP 5,2013,101371journalpone0073427,"[Moore, Megan; Berejikian, Barry A.; Tezak, Eugene P.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Manchester Res Lab, Manchester, WA USA.","Moore, M (reprint author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Fisheries, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Manchester Res Lab, Manchester, WA USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0073427

ecology","Biomechanical models of feeding mechanisms elucidate how animals capture food in the wild, which, in turn, expands our understanding of their fundamental trophic niche. However, little attention has been given to modeling the protrusible upper jaw apparatus that characterizes many teleost species. We expanded existing biomechanical models to include upper jaw forces using a generalist butterflyfish, Chaetodon trichrous (Chaetodontidae) that produces substantial upper jaw protrusion when feeding on midwater and benthic prey. Laboratory feeding trials for C. trichrous were recorded using high-speed digital imaging; from these sequences we quantified feeding performance parameters to use as inputs for the biomechanical model. According to the model outputs, the upper jaw makes a substantial contribution to the overall forces produced during mouth closing in C trichrous. Thus, biomechanical models that only consider lower jaw closing forces will underestimate total bite force for this and likely other teleost species. We also quantified and subsequently modeled feeding events for C trichrous consuming prey from the water column versus picking attached prey from the substrate to investigate whether there is a functional trade-off between prey capture modes. We found that individuals of C. trichrous alter their feeding behavior when consuming different prey types by changing the timing and magnitude of upper and lower jaw movements and that this behavioral modification will affect the forces produced by the jaws during prey capture by dynamically altering the lever mechanics of the jaws. In fact, the slower, lower magnitude movements produced during picking-based prey capture should produce a more forceful bite, which will facilitate feeding on benthic attached prey items, such as corals. Similarities between butterflyfishes and other teleost lineages that also employ picking-based prey capture suggest that a suite of key behavioral and morphological innovations enhances feeding success for benthic attached prey items.

Theoretically, these points can be viewed as being generated by stochastic processes that in the simplest cases are Gaussian random walks on featureless landscapes. Generalizations have been made of walks that (i) take place on landscapes with features, (ii) have correlated distributions of velocity and direction of movement in each time interval, (iii) are Levy processes in which distance or waiting-time (time-between steps) distributions have infinite moments, or (iv) have paths bounded in space and time. We begin by demonstrating that rather mild truncations of fat-tailed step-size distributions have a dramatic effect on dispersion of organisms, where such truncations naturally arise in real walks of organisms bounded by space and, more generally, influenced by the interactions of physiological, behavioral, and ecological factors with landscape features. These generalizations permit not only increased realism and hence greater accuracy in constructing movement pathways, but also provide a biogeographically detailed epistemological framework for interpreting movement patterns in all organisms, whether tossed in the wind or willfully driven. We illustrate the utility of our framework by demonstrating how fission-fusion herding behavior arises among individuals endeavoring to satisfy both nutritional and safety demands in heterogeneous environments.

Information about human mobility, such as 'when, where and why people travel', is contained in these datasets and is necessary for urban planning and public policy making. Nevertheless, how to segregate the users into groups with different movement and behaviours and generalise the patterns of groups are still challenging. To address this, this article develops a theoretical framework for uncovering space-time activity patterns from individual's movement trajectory data and segregating users into subgroups according to these patterns. In this framework, individuals' activities are modelled as their visits to spatio-temporal region of interests (ST-ROIs) by incorporating both the time and places the activities take place. An individual's behaviour is defined as his/her profile of time allocation on the ST-ROIs she/he visited. A hierarchical approach is adopted to segregate individuals into subgroups based upon the similarity of these individuals' profiles.

These movements include seasonal migrations (e.g. between breeding and feeding grounds), natal dispersal, nomadic range shifts and responses to local environmental disruptions. While various heuristic tools exist for identifying range shifts and migrations, none explicitly model the movement of the animals within a statistical framework that facilitates quantitative comparisons.
2. We present the mechanistic range shift analysis (MRSA), a method to estimate a suite of range shift parameters: times of initiation, duration of transitions, centroids and areas of respective ranges. The method can take the autocorrelation and irregular sampling that is characteristic of much movement data into account. The mechanistic parameters suggest an intuitive measure, the range shift index, for the extent of a range shift. The likelihood based estimation further allows for statistical tests of several relevant hypotheses, including a range shift test, a stopover test and a site fidelity test. The analysis tools are provided in an R package (MARCHER).
3. We applied the MRSA to a population of GPS tracked roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Italian Alps between 2005 and 2008. With respect to seasonal migration, this population is extremely variable and difficult to classify. Using the MRSA, we were able to quantify the behaviours across the population and among individuals across years, identifying extents, durations and locations of seasonal range shifts, including cases that would have been ambiguous to detect using existing tools.
4. The strongest patterns were differences across years: many animals simply did not perform a seasonal migration to wintering grounds during the mild winter of 2006-2007, even though some of these same animals did move extensively in other, harsher winters. For seasonal migrants, however, site fidelity across years was extremely high, even after skipping an entire seasonal migration. These results suggest that for roe deer behavioural plasticity and tactical responses to immediate environmental cues are reflected in the decision of whether rather than where to migrate. The MRSA also revealed a trade-off between the probability of migrating and the size of a home range.",WILEY,JUL,2017,1.01111136526561E+018,"[Gurarie, Eliezer; Fleming, Christen H.; Calabrese, Justin M.; Fagan, William F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA./[Cagnacci, Francesca; Peters, Wibke] Fdn Edmund Mach, IASMA Res & Innovat Ctr, Biodivers & Mol Ecol Dept, San Michele All Adige, Italy./[Cagnacci, Francesca] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA./[Peters, Wibke] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA./[Fleming, Christen H.; Calabrese, Justin M.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Conservat Ecol Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Front Royal, VA USA./[Mueller, Thomas] Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Frankfurt, Germany./[Mueller, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Biol Sci, Frankfurt, Germany.","Gurarie, E (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",NA

Similarly, it is often assumed that animals that fall in different body mass modes and share the same body plan will use landscapes at different spatial scales. We developed a new methodological framework for understanding the scaling of foraging (i.e. the range and distribution of scales at which animals use their landscapes) by applying a combination of three well-established methods to satellite telemetry data to quantify foraging patch size distributions: (1) first-passage time analysis; (2) a movement-based kernel density estimator; and (3) statistical comparison of resulting histograms and tests for multimodality. We demonstrate our approach using two sympatric, ecologically similar species of African ducks with quite different body masses: Egyptian Geese (actually a shelduck), and Red-billed Teal. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the two species, which are sympatric throughout the year, foraged at almost identical spatial scales. Our results show how ecologists can use GPS tracking data to explicitly quantify and compare the scales of foraging by different organisms within an animal community.

The cannibalistic behaviour of S. serrata coupled with the potential attraction of increased predators may counteract the effect of excluding fishing from these areas as a means of increasing the local crab population. The population dynamics of S. serrata could also be confounded by the spatio-temporal variability in environmental conditions (e.g. run-off and temperature). Here, we used a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) to explore the population dynamics of S. serrata in an MPA located in southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. This IBM simulated the life cycle dynamics of individual S. serrata and integrated the key processes affecting its population dynamics. These processes include physical transport of the planktonic life stages, movement, growth, metamorphosis, setting, reproduction, spawning, harvesting, and predation. Individual variability was built into the model to account for demographic variation. The modelled scenarios indicated that the effect of the different harvest strategies trialled on the population dynamics after 30 months and the MPA influenced the number of individuals in the creek system resulting in a partial 35 population increase.

These data sets may differ substantially from those that are collected with technologies suitable for fine-scale movement modelling and may consist of locations that are irregular in time, are temporally coarse or have large measurement error. These data sets are time-consuming and costly to collect but may still provide valuable information about movement behaviour.

The FTECF is applicable to inertial and magnetic sensors, which include tri-axis gyroscopes, tri-axis accelerometers, and tri-axis magnetometers. More specifically, the proposed method incorporates three parts, the input quaternion, the reference quaternion, and the fuzzy logic algorithm. At first, the input quaternion was calculated with gyroscopes. Then, the reference quaternion was calculated by applying the Second EStimator of the Optimal Quaternion (ESOQ-2) algorithm on accelerometers and magnetometers. In addition, we added compensation for accelerometers in the ESOQ-2 algorithm so as to eliminate the effects of limb motion acceleration in high-speed human motion measurements. Finally, the fuzzy logic was utilized to calculate the fusion factor for a complementary filter, so as to adaptively fuse the input quaternion with the reference quaternion. Additionally, the overall algorithm design is more simplified than traditional methods. Confirmed by the experiments, using a commercial inertial and magnetic sensors unit and an optical motion capture system, the efficiency of the proposed method was more improved than two well-known methods.

However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this ""toolbox'' of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide variety of species and applications. As a unified state-space modeling framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data, including time allocations to different movement behavior states, transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of movement behavior. Using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi-model inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward haul-out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area-restricted, and exploratory movements associated with haul-out, foraging, and other behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting animal movement, we believe that the development and application of custom-made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists and non-statisticians.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,AUG,2012,1018901103261,"[McClintock, Brett T.; King, Ruth; Thomas, Len] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, Scotland./[McClintock, Brett T.; King, Ruth; Thomas, Len] Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, St Andrews KY16 9LZ, Fife, Scotland./[Matthiopoulos, Jason; McConnell, Bernie J.] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland./[Morales, Juan M.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","McClintock, BT (reprint author), NOAA, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",NA

Through the proposed general framework, several popular resource selection models are shown to be special cases of the general model by making assumptions about animal movement and behavior. The weighted distribution framework is shown to be easily extended to readily account for telemetry data that are highly autocorrelated; as is typical with use of new technology such as global positioning systems animal relocations.

equation","The movement of organisms is usually leptokurtic in which some individuals move long distances while the majority remains at or near the area they are released. There has been extensive research into the origin of such leptokurtic movement, but one important aspect that has been overlooked is that the foraging behaviour of most organisms is not Brownian as assumed in most existing models. In this paper we show that such non-Brownian foraging indeed gives rise to leptokurtic distribution. We first present a general random walk model to describe the organism movement by breaking the foraging of each individual into events of active movement and inactive stationary period; its foraging behaviour is therefore fully characterized by a joint probability of how far the individual can move in each active movement and the duration it remains stationary between two consecutive movements. The spatio-temporal distribution of the organism can be described by a generalized partial differential equation, and the leptokurtic distribution is a special case when the stationary period is not exponentially distributed. Empirical observations of some organisms living in different habitats indicated that their rest time shows a power-law distribution, and we speculate that this is general for other organisms. This leads to a fractional diffusion equation with three parameters to characterize the distributions of stationary period and movement distance. A method to estimate the parameters from empirical data is given, and we apply the model to simulate the movement of two organisms living in different habitats: a stream fish (Cyprinidae: Nocomis leptocephalus) in water, and a root-feeding weevil, Sitona lepidus in the soil. Comparison of the simulations with the measured data shows close agreement. This has an important implication in ecology that the leptokurtic distribution observed at population level does not necessarily mean population heterogeneity as most existing models suggested, in which the population consists of different phenotypes; instead, a homogeneous population moving in homogeneous habitat can also lead to leptokurtic distribution.

Predicting their behaviour often requires models that mimic these systems with sufficient accuracy, while accounting for their inherent stochasticity. Although tools exist to determine which of a set of candidate models is best relative to the others, there is currently no generic goodness-of-fit framework for testing how close the best model is to the real complex stochastic system. We propose such a framework, using a novel application of the Earth mover's distance, also known as the Wasserstein metric. It is applicable to any stochastic process where the probability of the model's state at time t is a function of the state at previous times. It generalizes the concept of a residual, often used to analyse 1D summary statistics, to situations where the complexity of the underlying model's probability distribution makes standard residual analysis too imprecise for practical use. We give a scheme for testing the hypothesis that a model is an accurate description of a data set. We demonstrate the tractability and usefulness of our approach by application to animal movement models in complex, heterogeneous environments. We detail methods for visualizing results and extracting a variety of information on a given model's quality, such as whether there is any inherent bias in the model, or in which situations, it is most accurate. We demonstrate our techniques by application to data on multispecies flocks of insectivore birds in the Amazon rain forest. This work provides a usable toolkit to assess the quality of generic movement models of complex systems, in an absolute rather than a relative sense. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi",WILEY-BLACKWELL,OCT,2014,1011112041210X12253,"[Potts, Jonathan R.; Auger-Methe, Marie; Lewis, Mark A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Ctr Math Biol, Edmonton, AB, Canada./[Potts, Jonathan R.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England./[Auger-Methe, Marie; Lewis, Mark A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada./[Mokross, Karl] Louisiana State Univ, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Ctr Agr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA./[Mokross, Karl] INPA, Projeto Dinam Biol Fragmentos Florestais, BR-69083000 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.","Potts, JR (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Ctr Math Biol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",NA

Uptake in general biology and ecology has been rapid. However, it often requires specific data sets that are overly costly in time and resources to collect. The aim of the current study was to test whether a generic behavioural ecology model constructed using published data could give realistic outputs for individual species. An individual-based model was developed using the Pattern-Oriented Modelling (POM) strategy and protocol, based on behavioural rules associated with insect movement choices. Frugivorous Tephritidae (fruit flies) were chosen because of economic significance in global agriculture and the multiple published data sets available for a range of species. The Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), Bactrocera tryoni, was identified as a suitable individual species for testing. Plant canopies with modified architecture were used to run predictive simulations. A field study was then conducted to validate our model predictions on how plant architecture affects fruit flies' behaviours. Characteristics of plant architecture such as different shapes, e.g., closed-canopy and vase-shaped, affected fly movement patterns and time spent on host fruit. The number of visits to host fruit also differed between the edge and centre in closed-canopy plants. Compared to plant architecture, host fruit has less contribution to effects on flies' movement patterns. The results from this Dmodel, combined with our field study and published empirical data suggest that placing fly traps in the upper canopy at the edge should work best. Such a modelling approach allows rapid testing of ideas about organismal interactions with environmental substrates in silico rather than in vivo, to generate new perspectives. Using published data provides a saving in time and resources. Adjustments for specific questions can be achieved by refinement of parameters based on targeted experiments.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 21,2016,101371journalpone0151777,"[Wang, Ming; Hanan, Jim] Univ Queensland, QAAFI, Brisbane, Qld, Australia./[Cribb, Bronwen] Univ Queensland, Ctr Microscopy & Microanal, Brisbane, Qld, Australia./[Cribb, Bronwen] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia./[Clarke, Anthony R.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Earth Environm & Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia./[Clarke, Anthony R.] Plant Biosecur Cooperat Res Ctr, Bruce, ACT, Australia.","Hanan, J (reprint author), Univ Queensland, QAAFI, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",10_1371_journal_pone_0151777

In stressful habitats motile organisms often exhibit behavioural patterns that are consistent with stress-minimizing strategies. In the present study we analysed the proportions of individuals with strong site fidelity and distances travelled by ""unfaithful"" individuals from their home scar at different temporal and spatial scales in the intertidal gastropod Siphonaria lessoni We also assessed the behavioural response of S. lessoni to biological pressures such as conspecific population density and food availability (assessed by measures of chlorophyll a). The experiments were carried out in the arid climate of Patagonia on the rocky intertidal of Las Grutas (LG), and in the humid climate of The Pampas on the rocky intertidal of Mar del Plata (MDP) Argentina. At each site, shells of five hundred animals were marked with epoxy paint. Movement was measured as distance to a reference point after periods of one, five and ten days. Our results showed a positive relationship between food availability, site fidelity and distance to home scar for almost all observation days, but no relationship between population density and behavioural variables. Limpets in LG were more ""faithful"" than in MDP. Unfaithful limpets had the same mean displacement for all days and seasons except for Spring day-1 where MDP was higher than in LG and in Autumn day-10 where MDP was smaller than LG. The present results thus show differential response behaviour in intertidal limpets probably driven by the environmental conditions in which they live. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In an effort to increase connectivity, managers of fenced conservancies can place strategic gaps along the fences to allow wildlife access to outside habitat, permitting exploration, dispersal and seasonal migration. Wildlife can become accustomed to certain movement pathways and can show fidelity to these routes over many years, even at the path level. Our study site has three dedicated wildlife crossings (fence-gaps) in its 142 km perimeter fence, and we continuously monitor these fence-gaps with camera-traps. We monitored one fence-gap before and after a 1.49 km fence section was completely removed and 6.8 km was reconfigured to leave only a two-strand electric fence meant to exclude elephant and giraffe, all other species being able to cross under the exclusionary fence. The removal and reconfiguration of the fence effectively rendered this fence-gap (which was left in place structurally) as a ""ghost"" fence-gap, as wildlife now had many options along the 8.29 km shared border to cross into the neighboring habitat. Although we documented some decline in the number of crossing events at the ghost-gap, surprisingly, 19 months after the total removal of the fence, we continued to document the usage of this crossing location by wildlife including by species that had not been previously detected at this location.

The model, a marked-point process with four parameters, describes a behavioral process defined by the movements of animal groups. My approach provides new methods to explore animal social behavior. I illustrate the fit of the model to field observations of 39 aggregations observed when they were not at equilibrium and outline a procedure for determining which parameters, and hence which behaviors, are constant across the 39 aggregations. A comparison of the predicted variablity in the model's parameter estimates, assuming constant parameter values for all 39 aggregations, to the observed variablity in the estimates suggests that waterfowl aggregation dynamics are affected by changing movement rates and not changes in group size: simulations reveal that the estimates of the arrival and departure rates are more variable than expected. In contrast, the estimates of the parameters describing movement group size do not show excessive variability. The fit of a constant parameter modified-geometric distribution to the group size data indicates that the formation of movement groups is not a complicated process. Analysis of the extra variability in the movement rates reveals two variables, migratory season and overall waterfowl density, that influence the behavior of aggregating birds. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

End-to-end models are complex and typically simulate full ecosystems from oceanography to foodwebs and fisheries, operate on a spatial framework, and link to physical oceanographic models. Most end-to-end approaches allow multiple ways to implement human behaviours involving fishery catch, fleet movement, or other impacts such as nutrient loading or climate change effects. Though end-to-end ecosystem models were designed specifically for marine management, their novelty makes them unfamiliar to most decision makers. Before such models can be applied within the context of marine management decisions, additional levels of vetting will be required, and a dialogue with decision makers must be initiated. Here we summarize a review of an Atlantis end-to-end model, which involved a multi-day, expert review panel with local and international experts, convened to challenge models and data used in the management context. We propose nine credibility and quality control standards for end-to-end models intended to inform management, and suggest two best practice guidelines for any end-to-end modelling application.

We assessed the fine and broad scale movement patterns of an exploited herbivore, luderick (Girella tricuspidata), using acoustic telemetry to evaluate how this species may respond to protection within Jervis Bay (New South Wales, Australia). We surgically implanted fourteen fish with acoustic transmitters and actively and passively tracked individuals to determine fine and broad scale movement patterns respectively. Eight fish were actively tracked for 24 h d(1) for 6 d (May 2011), and then intermittently over the following 30 d. Six fish were passively tracked from December 2011 to March 2012, using a fixed array of receivers deployed across rocky reefs around the perimeter of the bay. Luderick exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs, tending to remain on or return consistently to the reef where they were caught and released. All eight fish actively tracked used core areas solely on their release reef, with the exception of one fish that used multiple core areas, and four of the six fish passively tracked spent between 75 to 96% of days on release reefs over the entire tracking period. Luderick did move frequently to adjacent reefs, and occasionally to more distant reefs, however consistently returned to their release reef. Luderick also exhibited predictable patterns in movement between spatially distinct daytime and night-time core use areas. Night-time core use areas were generally located in sheltered areas behind the edge of reefs. Overall, our data indicate luderick exhibit strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs in Jervis Bay and suggests that this important herbivore may be likely to show a positive response to protection within the marine park.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 31,2013,101371journalpone0065838,"[Ferguson, Adrian M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia./[Ferguson, Adrian M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia./[Ferguson, Adrian M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Conservat Biol & Environm Management, Wollongong, NSW, Australia./[Taylor, Matthew D.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Taylors Beach, NSW, Australia./[Knott, Nathan A.] Jervis Bay Marine Park, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Huskisson, NSW, Australia.","Ferguson, AM (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia.",10_1371_journal_pone_0065838

Although both aim at different, seemingly opposing goals, i.e. maintenance of biodiversity values versus maximization of animal production, they nonetheless have a common interest in maintaining the rangeland or natural environment in a state that ensures either the first or the second goal. In order to accomplish an effective and efficient grazing management, in terms of grazer density, grazer composition, grazing seasonality, and to prevent under- and overgrazing, a grazing capacity model (GCM) was developed, that should be applicable in both rangeland and nature conservation management conditions and that takes spatio-temporal environmental variation into account. This spatio-temporally dynamic model considers crucial variables at both the terrain and the grazer level, such as (seasonally) fluctuating forage yield, forage quality, plant palatability, accessibility of the area, soil erosion vulnerability, animal nutritive requirements, animal behaviour and general habitat condition. It predicts the optimal grazer species and density, taking into account the seasonal variation in animal needs and fluctuating terrain characteristics. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to define each parameter's relative impact on the final outcome of the model.
We present the GCM outline and illustrate the functionality of this model for Shetland ponies and Highland cattle, grazing in a temperate coastal dune environment. According to the model, seasonal fluctuations in optimal grazer densities occur: the area can support higher densities in summer and autumn than it can during winter and spring. With the current density of grazing animals and the choice for year-round grazing at non-fluctuating animal densities, the model consequently predicts overgrazing in winter and undergrazing in summer and autumn. Both undergrazing and overgrazing scenarios might lead to non-sustainable situations in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Based on these devices, an immersive virtual geographic environment (VGE) provides a promising method for research into crowd behavior in an emergency. However, the current cheaper helmet-mounted VR devices are not popular enough, and will continue to coexist with personal computer (PC)-based systems for a long time. Therefore, a heterogeneous distributed virtual geographic environment (HDVGE) could be a feasible solution to the heterogeneous problems caused by various types of clients, and support the implementation of spatiotemporal crowd behavior experiments with large numbers of concurrent participants. In this study, we developed an HDVGE framework, and put forward a set of design principles to define the similarities between the real world and the VGE. We discussed the HDVGE architecture, and proposed an abstract interaction layer, a protocol-based interaction algorithm, and an adjusted dead reckoning algorithm to solve the heterogeneous distributed problems. We then implemented an HDVGE prototype system focusing on subway fire evacuation experiments. Two types of clients are considered in the system: PC, and all-in-one VR. Finally, we evaluated the performances of the prototype system and the key algorithms. The results showed that in a low-latency local area network (LAN) environment, the prototype system can smoothly support 90 concurrent users consisting of PC and all-in-one VR clients. HDVGE provides a feasible solution for studying not only spatiotemporal crowd behaviors in normal conditions, but also evacuation behaviors in emergency conditions such as fires and earthquakes.

geolocation; Template fitting","Background: Solar archival tags (henceforth called geolocators) are tracking devices deployed on animals to reconstruct their long-distance movements on the basis of locations inferred post hoc with reference to the geographical and seasonal variations in the timing and speeds of sunrise and sunset. The increased use of geolocators has created a need for analytical tools to produce accurate and objective estimates of migration routes that are explicit in their uncertainty about the position estimates.
Results: We developed a hidden Markov chain model for the analysis of geolocator data. This model estimates tracks for animals with complex migratory behaviour by combining: (1) a shading-insensitive, template-fit physical model, (2) an uncorrelated random walk movement model that includes migratory and sedentary behavioural states, and (3) spatially explicit behavioural masks. The model is implemented in a specially developed open source R package FLightR. We used the particle filter (PF) algorithm to provide relatively fast model posterior computation. We illustrate our modelling approach with analysis of simulated data for stationary tags and of real tracks of both a tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor migrating along the east and a golden-crowned sparrow Zonotrichia atricapilla migrating along the west coast of North America.
Conclusions: We provide a model that increases accuracy in analyses of noisy data and movements of animals with complicated migration behaviour.

Flemming, Joanna Mills",NA,NA,NA,"Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement through time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate tracking data are now becoming more common. We developed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks with negligible error, called the hidden Markov movement model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the process equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and the R package TMB for rapid model fitting. The HMMM was compared to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly accurate tracks, the DCRWSNOME, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted with the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout, and blue shark, as well as to simulated data. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the popular DCRWS implementation and have highly accurate tracking data. It additionally provides a groundwork for development of more complex modeling of animal movement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R package swim.",NA,APR,2017,101002ece32795,NA,NA,10_1002_ece3_2795

Karanth, K. Ullas",PLOS ONE,"CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS; TIGER PANTHERA-TIGRIS; POPULATION-DENSITY;
CAMERA-TRAP; INFERENCE; INDIA",NA,"Motivation
Several spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have been developed to estimate animal abundance by analyzing the detections of individuals in a spatial array of traps. Most of these models do not use the actual dates and times of detection, even though this information is readily available when using continuous-time recorders, such as microphones or motion-activated cameras. Instead most SCR models either partition the period of trap operation into a set of subjectively chosen discrete intervals and ignore multiple detections of the same individual within each interval, or they simply use the frequency of detections during the period of trap operation and ignore the observed times of detection. Both practices make inefficient use of potentially important information in the data.
Model and data analysis
We developed a hierarchical SCR model to estimate the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected with continuous-time recorders. Our model includes two kinds of point processes: a spatial process to specify the distribution of latent activity centers of individuals within the region of sampling and a temporal process to specify temporal patterns in the detections of individuals. We illustrated this SCR model by analyzing spatial and temporal patterns evident in the camera-trap detections of tigers living in and around the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in India. We also conducted a simulation study to examine the performance of our model when analyzing data sets of greater complexity than the tiger data.
Benefits
Our approach provides three important benefits: First, it exploits all of the information in SCR data obtained using continuous-time recorders. Second, it is sufficiently versatile to allow the effects of both space use and behavior of animals to be specified as functions of covariates that vary over space and time. Third, it allows both the spatial distribution and abundance of individuals to be estimated, effectively providing a species distribution model, even in cases where spatial covariates of abundance are unknown or unavailable. We illustrated these benefits in the analysis of our data, which allowed us to quantify differences between nocturnal and diurnal activities of tigers and to estimate their spatial distribution and abundance across the study area. Our continuous-time SCR model allows an analyst to specify many of the ecological processes thought to be involved in the distribution, movement, and behavior of animals detected in a spatial trapping array of continuous-time recorders. We plan to extend this model to estimate the population dynamics of animals detected during multiple years of SCR surveys.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 17,2017,101371journalpone0176966,"[Dorazio, Robert M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA./[Karanth, K.

Mathematical models of zebrafish behaviour are expected to considerably aid in the design of hypothesis-driven studies by enabling preliminary in silico tests that can be used to infer possible experimental outcomes without the use of zebrafish. This study is motivated by observations of sudden, drastic changes in zebrafish locomotion in the form of large deviations in turn rate. We demonstrate that such deviations can be captured through a stochastic mean reverting jump diffusion model, a process that is commonly used in financial engineering to describe large changes in the price of an asset. The jump process-based model is validated on trajectory data of adult subjects swimming in a shallow circular tank obtained from an overhead camera. Through statistical comparison of the empirical distribution of the turn rate against theoretical predictions, we demonstrate the feasibility of describing zebrafish as a jump persistent turning walker. The critical role of the jump term is assessed through comparison with a simplified mean reversion diffusion model, which does not allow for describing the heavy-tailed distributions observed in the fish turn rate.",ROYAL SOC,JAN 6,2015,101098rsif20140884,"[Mwaffo, Violet; Anderson, Ross P.; Porfiri, Maurizio] NYU, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Polytech Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA./[Butail, Sachit] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol Delhi IIITD, New Delhi, India.","Porfiri, M (reprint author), NYU, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Polytech Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",4277079

In this study we applied the landscape of coexistence concept to a large predator in Europe. We investigated to what extent Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx habitat selection is affected by human disturbance in a human dominated landscape. More specifically, we were interested in the existence of a tradeoff between the availability of roe deer, one of their main prey and avoidance of human disturbance and how this affects the spatio-temporal space use patterns of lynx. We found that lynx face a tradeoff between high prey availability and avoidance of human disturbance and that they respond to this by using areas of high prey availability (but also high human disturbance) during the night when human activity is low. Furthermore our analysis showed that lynx increase their travelling speed and remain more in cover when they are close to areas of high human disturbance. Despite clear behavioral adjustments in response to human presence, prey availability still proved to be the most important predictor of lynx occurrence at small spatial scale, whereas human disturbance was considerably less important. The results of our study demonstrate how spatio-temporal adaptations in habitat selection enable large carnivores to persist in human dominated landscapes and demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of a landscape of coexistence to develop adaptive management plans for endangered populations of large carnivores.",WILEY,OCT,2017,101111oik04182,"[Gehr, Benedikt; Muff, Stefanie; Keller, Lukas F.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland./[Muff, Stefanie] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Zurich, Switzerland./[Hofer, Elizabeth J.; Ryser, Andreas; Vimercati, Eric; Vogt, Kristina] KORA, Carnivore Ecol & Wildlife Management, Muri, Switzerland./[Vogt, Kristina] Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci Zool & Evolut, Basel, Switzerland.","Gehr, B (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",10_1111_oik_04182

However, compared with their success in reducing coyote (Canis latrans) depredations, commonly used LGD breeds appear less effective against wolves (Canis lupus). With more than 30 distinct LGD breeds found throughout the world, certain breeds may be more effective at deterring specific threats. We compared LGD breeds commonly used in the United States, collectively called whitedogs, with three European breeds selected for boldness toward carnivores, history of use in areas with wolves, lack of aggression toward humans, and size. We collected data on LGD behavior with sheep herds in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming in 2015 and 2016. We also developed a test to examine LGDs' response to a simulated encounterwith a wolfwhile on summer grazing range. Results fromgeneralized linear mixedmodels of proportion of time spent in a given behavior indicate that few significant behavioral differences exist among tested breeds. Kangals tended to be more investigative when engaging a decoy, karakachans more vigilant, and transmontanos more able to decipher a threatening from unthreatening stimulus. Transmontanos also spent less time scanning than whitedogs, and there was a marginally significant effect of karakachans moving more than whitedogs. While these subtle behavioral differences may help livestock producers make tailored decisions in choosing the appropriate LGD for their needs and circumstance, our results suggest that behavioral differences among breeds may be less common than often suggested.

The goal of our study was to improve our understanding of the biological value of dense conifer cover to deer on winter range relative to snow depth and ambient temperature.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined variation among deer in their use of dense conifer cover during a 12-year study period as potentially influenced by winter severity and cover availability. Female deer were fitted with a mixture of very high frequency (VHF, n = 267) and Global Positioning System (GPS, n = 24) collars for monitoring use of specific cover types at the population and individual levels, respectively. We developed habitat composites for four study sites. We fit multinomial response models to VHF (daytime) data to describe population-level use patterns as a function of snow depth, ambient temperature, and cover availability. To develop alternative hypotheses regarding expected spatio-temporal patterns in the use of dense conifer cover, we considered two sets of competing sub-hypotheses. The first set addressed whether or not dense conifer cover was limiting on the four study sites. The second set considered four alternative sub-hypotheses regarding the potential influence of snow depth and ambient temperature on space use patterns. Deer use of dense conifer cover increased the most with increasing snow depth and most abruptly on the two sites where it was most available, suggestive of an energy conservation strategy. Deer use of dense cover decreased the most with decreasing temperatures on the sites where it was most available. At all four sites deer made greater daytime use (55 to >80% probability of use) of open vegetation types at the lowest daily minimum temperatures indicating the importance of thermal benefits afforded from increased exposure to solar radiation. Date-time plots of GPS data (24 hr) allowed us to explore individual diurnal and seasonal patterns of habitat use relative to changes in snow depth. There was significant among-animal variability in their propensity to be found in three density classes of conifer cover and other open types, but little difference between diurnal and nocturnal patterns of habitat use.
Conclusions/Significance: Consistent with our findings reported elsewhere that snow depth has a greater impact on deer survival than ambient temperature, herein our population-level results highlight the importance of dense conifer cover as snow shelter rather than thermal cover. Collectively, our findings suggest that maximizing availability of dense conifer cover in an energetically beneficial arrangement with quality feeding sites should be a prominent component of habitat management for deer.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 13,2013,101371journalpone0065368,"[DelGiudice, Glenn D.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Forest Wildlife Populat & Res Grp, Forest Lake, MN USA./[DelGiudice, Glenn D.; Fieberg, John R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA./[Fieberg, John R.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Biometr Unit, Forest Lake, MN USA./[Sampson, Barry A.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Forest Wildlife Populat & Res Grp, Grand Rapids, MN USA.","DelGiudice, GD (reprint author), Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Forest Wildlife Populat & Res Grp, Forest Lake, MN USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0065368

In the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) have adapted to a human-modified environment, sleeping on the urban edge and raiding anthropogenic food sources on a daily basis. Human monitors, who herd baboons away from residential areas, are currently the preferred method of conflict mitigation. However, this method is costly and suffers from short-term interruptions, wherein the unexpected absence of monitors may lead to unprepared residents using lethal force to deter raiding baboons. Elsewhere in the chacma baboon distribution (in nonconflict areas), artificial food patches have been shown to alter troop movements drastically by eliciting consistent leadership behavior from alpha males. We investigated whether an artificial patch could be used to draw baboons away from the urban environment in the absence of monitors. First, we introduced an artificial food patch into natural land within a troop's range and monitored movement and activity patterns. Although the troop utilized the patch, there was not a significant decline in use of the urban space as they continued to favor food in urban waste sites. Maintaining the patch, we then restricted access to these waste sites using wire-mesh fencing and observed a significant reduction in the time the troop spent within the urban space. In both experimental phases we observed consistent leadership, with dominant individuals arriving first at the patch and monopolizing food items thereon. Thus, we recommend the combined strategy of reducing raiding incentives in conjunction with provisioning as a short-term, cost-effective strategy to alter a baboon troop's movement patterns and raiding frequency.",SPRINGER,DEC,2011,101007s1076401195418,"[Kaplan, Bentley S.; O'Riain, M.

Often such studies are cited as justification for forest volume or standing biomass estimation through remote sensing. With resolution of common satellite remote sensing systems generally too low to resolve individuals, and a need for larger coverage, these systems rely on descriptive heights, which account for tree collections in forests. For remote sensing and allometric applications, this height is not entirely understood in terms of its location. Here, a forest growth model (SERA) analyzes forest canopy height relationships with forest wood volume. Maximum height, mean, H-100, and Lorey's height are examined for variability under plant number density, resource and species. Our findings, shown to be allometrically consistent with empirical measurements for forested communities world-wide, are analyzed for implications to forest remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR and RADAR. Traditional forestry measures of maximum height, and to a lesser extent H-100 and Lorey's, exhibit little consistent correlation with forest volume across modeled conditions. The implication is that using forest height to infer volume or biomass from remote sensing requires species and community behavioral information to infer accurate estimates using height alone. SERA predicts mean height to provide the most consistent relationship with volume of the height classifications studied and overall across forest variations. This prediction agrees with empirical data collected from conifer and angiosperm forests with plant densities ranging between 10(2)- 10(6) plants/hectare and heights 6-49 m. Height classifications investigated are potentially linked to radar scattering centers with implications for allometry. These findings may be used to advance forest biomass estimation accuracy through remote sensing. Furthermore, Lorey's height with its specific relationship to remote sensing physics is recommended as a more universal indicator of volume when using remote sensing than achieved using either maximum height or H-100.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 23,2012,101371journalpone0033927,"[Brolly, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA./[Woodhouse, Iain H.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland./[Niklas, Karl J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Ithaca, NY USA./[Hammond, Sean T.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ USA.","Brolly, M (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0033927

One gap in knowledge concerns the pattern and extent of pollinator movement among these sexually deceptive flowers and how this translates to pollen and gene flow. Our aim was to use mark and recapture techniques to investigate the behavior and movement of male Colletes cunicularius, an important bee pollinator of Ophrys. Our study site was located in northern Switzerland where a large population of the bees was nesting. Within two plots, (10x40 in), we marked bees with different colors and numbered tags. Seventeen percent of the 577 marked bees were recaptured over a period of 1 to a maximum of 11 days. However, the number of recaptures dropped dramatically after 3-5 days, suggesting an average lifetime of less than 10 days. Mark-recapture distances varied from 0 to 50 in, with a mean of 5 in. Our findings show that individual male bees patrol a specific and restricted region of the nesting area in search of mates. This mark-recapture study provides the first clues about the potential movement of pollen within populations of Ophrys orchids. We predict that orchid-pollen movements mediated by bees will be similar to the mark-recapture distances in this study.

Wildlife; Vegetative obstruction; Topographic obstruction","Global positioning system (GPS) collars have revolutionized the collection of animal location data; however, it is well-recognized that considerable bias can be present in these data due to habitat or behavior-induced obstruction of satellite signals resulting in inaccurate or missing locations. To date, no explicit theoretical framework of GPS fix acquisition specific to animal telemetry has been presented, and studies make differing assumptions regarding factors influencing GPS fix acquisition and how these data should be analyzed. Inappropriate statistical models have been used, interaction effects have been misunderstood, and the implementation of bias mitigation techniques has been problematic. Herein we outline current conceptual and analytical problems in the GPS animal telemetry literature, and subsequently present a theoretical model-based framework for GPS fix acquisition that clarifies the single and interactive effects of habitat and behavioral obstruction, fix interval, and collar model on GPS collar performance. By recognizing that GPS fix acquisition is a Bernoulli process, it becomes apparent that all forms of obstruction inherently interact with each other, making generalizations across study areas, study species, and collar models problematic. Stationary collar tests to determine the probability of fix acquisition (PFA), location accuracy, and the response to sources of obstruction are thus of limited applicability to animal-deployed collars. Bias mitigation techniques that extrapolate PFA models across samples, especially those using stationary collar tests to correct animal-deployed collars, are theoretically unsound. It is also demonstrated that nonlinearities in the relationships between sources of obstruction and PFA complicate PFA modeling with limited data and that even slight model misspecification can lead to considerable errors in correction factors, especially when using inverse weighting to mitigate bias. By emphasizing the importance of GPS collar sensitivity and ephemeris retention, the theoretical framework predicts that newer, more sensitive GPS collars will be less severely biased by sources of obstruction than reported for the older, less sensitive collars that have been used in the majority of GPS performance studies to date and we expect this trend to continue. This heuristic modeling exercise should be of value to researchers planning and analyzing studies using GPS collars and it also establishes a starting point for future theoretical investigations into GPS collar performance and bias mitigation.

However, the errors of a MEMS IMU based standalone Inertial Navigation System (INS) will diverge over time dramatically, since there are various and nonlinear errors contained in the MEMS IMU measurements. Therefore, MEMS INS is usually integrated with a Global Positioning System (GPS) for providing reliable navigation solutions. The GPS receiver is able to generate stable and precise position and time information in open sky environment. However, under signal challenging conditions, for instance dense forests, city canyons, or mountain valleys, if the GPS signal is weak and even is blocked, the GPS receiver will fail to output reliable positioning information, and the integration system will fade to an INS standalone system. A number of effects have been devoted to improving the accuracy of INS, and de-nosing or modelling the random errors contained in the MEMS IMU have been demonstrated to be an effective way of improving MEMS INS performance. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) method was proposed to de-noise the MEMS IMU output signals, specifically, a popular variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN was employed to filter the MEMS gyroscope outputs, in which the signals were treated as time series. A MEMS IMU (MSI3200, manufactured by MT Microsystems Company, Shijiazhuang, China) was employed to test the proposed method, a 2 min raw gyroscope data with 400 Hz sampling rate was collected and employed in this testing. The results show that the standard deviation (STD) of the gyroscope data decreased by 60.3%, 37%, and 44.6% respectively compared with raw signals, and on the other way, the three-axis attitude errors decreased by 15.8%, 18.3% and 51.3% individually. Further, compared with an Auto Regressive and Moving Average (ARMA) model with fixed parameters, the STD of the three-axis gyroscope outputs decreased by 42.4%, 21.4% and 21.4%, and the attitude errors decreased by 47.6%, 42.3% and 52.0%. The results indicated that the de-noising scheme was effective for improving MEMS INS accuracy, and the proposed LSTM-RNN method was more preferable in this application.",MDPI,OCT,2018,103390s18103470,"[Jiang, Changhui; Chen, Shuai; Zhang, Boya; Bo, Yuming] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China./[Jiang, Changhui; Chen, Yuwei; Feng, Ziyi] Finnish Geospatial Res Inst FGI, Ctr Excellence Laser Scanning Res, Geodeetinrinne 2, FI-02431 Kyrkslatt, Finland./[Zhou, Hui] Wuhan Univ, Dept Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.","Chen, S (reprint author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",NA

Different from fixed-axis gearboxes, planetary gearboxes exhibit unique behaviors, which invalidate fault diagnosis methods that work well for fixed-axis gearboxes. It is a fact that for systems as complex as planetary gearboxes, multiple sensors mounted on different locations provide complementary information on the health condition of the systems. On this basis, a fault detection method based on multi-sensor data fusion is introduced in this paper. In this method, two features developed for planetary gearboxes are used to characterize the gear health conditions, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized to fuse all features from different sensors. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are carried out on a planetary gearbox test rig, on which multiple accelerometers are mounted for data collection. The comparisons between the proposed method and the methods based on individual sensors show that the former achieves much higher accuracies in detecting planetary gearbox faults.",MDPI AG,FEB,2012,103390s120202005,"[Lei, Yaguo; Lin, Jing; He, Zhengjia; Kong, Detong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China./[Lei, Yaguo] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.","Lei, YG (reprint author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, 28 Xianning W Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",3304152

This is not ideal for many types of study in locomotion since only a few strides may be collected per 'trial', and outdoor experiments are difficult with some systems. Here, we report and evaluate a novel approach that enables the user to determine linear displacements of a proprietary orientation sensor during cyclical movement. This makes experiments outside the constraints of the laboratory possible, for example to measure mechanical energy fluctuations of the centre of mass during over-ground locomotion. Commercial orientation sensors based on inertial sensing are small and lightweight and provide a theoretical framework for determining position from acceleration. In practice, the integration process is difficult to implement because of integration errors, integration constants and the necessity to determine the orientation of the measured accelerations. Here, by working within the constraints of cyclical movements, we report and evaluate a method for determining orientation and relative position using a modified version of a commercial inertial orientation sensor that combines accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers, thus giving a full set of movement parameters (displacement, velocity and acceleration in three dimensions). The 35 g sensor was attached over the spine of a horse exercising on a treadmill. During canter locomotion (9.0 m s(-1)), the amplitudes of trunk movement in the x (craniocaudal), y (mediolateral) and z (dorsoventral) directions were 99.6, 57.9 and 140.2 mm, respectively. Comparing sensor displacement values with optical motion capture values for individual strides, the sensor had a median error (25th, 75th percentile) in the x, y and z directions of 0.1 (-9.7, +10.8), -3.8 (-15.5, +13.7) and -0.1 (-6.3, +7.1) mm, respectively. High-pass filtering of the displacement data effectively separated non-cyclical from cyclical components of the movement and reduced the interquartile ranges of the errors considerably to (-3.6, 6.2), (-4.0, 3.8) and (-4.5, 5.1) for x, y and z displacement, respectively, during canter locomotion.

Whereas detection functions typically ( e. g. for distance sampling) describe the probability of direct human observations of animal subjects, we adapted this approach for cryptic species where observation depends on animals being caught in traps. Specifically, we characterised the probability of individual brushtail possums being caught by leg-hold traps in an area of farmland and native forest in New Zealand. Detection probability was defined as the per-individual, per-trap, per-night probability of a possum being captured, and was modelled as a function of home-range utilisation. Radio-telemetry was used to define the home-range distributions of 18 possums, and a combination of scanning radio-receivers and movement-activated video-cameras recorded instances when radio-collared possums encountered and stepped on the trigger of leg-hold traps ( inactivated by being wired open). We estimated a 5% chance of trapping individual possums with a single leg-hold trap located in the centre of their home range for one night ( median value across possums). Furthermore, this probability decreased rapidly as a function of distance, so that at 120 m from the centre of the home range there was less than a 1% chance of trapping success per possum per night.

One reason for this gap is that methods for longer term tracking are not well developed for the majority of species, especially those of smaller size. In this study we describe a methodology for the long-term attachment of electronic tags to free-ranging cuttlefish of a broad size range. Five common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis (122-240 mm mantle length) were fitted with temperature and depth-logging archival tags attached to the internal cuttlebone of the living animal (tag weight was <1.8% of body weight). Tagged animals recovered rapidly from sedative and surgical procedures and resumed feeding within 24 h of tag attachment. Laboratory-kept cuttlefish maintained in a 2-m deep aquarium exhibited diel vertical movements, spending daylight hours close to the bottom and ascending into the water column at night, a behaviour which is consistent with normal diel vertical migration seen in other marine organisms such as zooplankton and fish. That regular feeding and expected patterns of depth use were observed indicates that tag attachment did not impede normal behaviours. Furthermore, tags remained attached to laboratory cuttlefish for up to 5 months, from first tagging through to natural mortality, and with the tag remaining attached to the cuttlebone post mortem. We also found that cuttle,bones with attached tags remained buoyant at the water's surface post mortem, offering the unique opportunity to recover archival tags from cuttlebones washed ashore. The capacity for long-term attachment to juvenile cuttlefish and recovery following natural mortality identifies the potential of this method for recording near 'lifetime' behaviour and movements of cuttlefish in their natural environment.

TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS","The use of statistics that assume independence between observations may not be an adequate tool in the analysis of how prey fish co-ordinate their swimming when inspecting piscine predators. This is mainly caused by the fact that continuity is an inevitable feature of locomotion. Thus, if one takes observations at close intervals, the assumption of independence will probably be violated, while observations taken too far apart may lose significant information of what goes on in between. In this paper we present one way of dealing with these problems and demonstrate what may come out when applied to empirical data of predator inspection in fish. The method models measurements taken at equispaced points in time as dynamic systems of simultaneous stochastic difference equations, and may well be applied in general to auto- and cross-correlated data. A full account of statistical procedures and how to estimate the order of difference equations is presented in an appendix. Swimming trajectories, represented as successive distances to predators at intervals of 2 s, were obtained from paired male guppies inspecting piscine predators. Dynamic models of swimming were then estimated and used for quantifying causes of locomotion that relates to inertia of own swimming, to motion of co-inspectors, and to independent causes generated elsewhere. The derived models complied with second order systems in 9 out of the 10 fish that were investigated. Feed-back relations within co-inspectors varied between pairs, but none of the fish moved independently of its partner. All models may be interpreted in terms of interacting attracting/repelling 'forces' between each prey fish and the predator. The way swimming by a particular fish affected co-inspectors was further analysed. Mean properties of this influence revealed that even when partners lagged behind inspecting individuals, they mostly behaved so as to make the leading fish approach the predators even further. This finding suggests other behavioural strategies to be involved than those assumed previously, and one alternative is discussed.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,FEB,1994,1.0101603766358E+021,NA,"BILDSOE, M (reprint author), UNIV COPENHAGEN,INST ZOOL,UNIV PK 15,DK-2100 COPENHAGEN 0,DENMARK.",NA

This technological advance would greatly benefit from the parallel development of dedicated methodologies accounting for the variety of timescales involved in the remote detection of tagged animals related to instrumental, environmental and behavioral events. In this paper we propose a methodological framework for estimating the site fidelity (""residence times"") of acoustic tagged animals at different timescales, based on the survival analysis of continuous residence times recorded at multiple receivers. Our approach is validated through modeling and applied on two distinct datasets obtained from a small coastal pelagic species (bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus) and a large, offshore pelagic species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares), which show very distinct spatial scales of behavior. The methodological framework proposed herein allows estimating the most appropriate temporal scale for processing passive acoustic telemetry data depending on the scientific question of interest. Our method provides residence times free of the bias inherent to environmental and instrumental noise that can be used to study the small scale behavior of acoustic tagged animals. At larger timescales, it can effectively identify residence times that encompass the diel behavioral excursions of fish out of the acoustic detection range. This study provides a systematic framework for the analysis of passive acoustic telemetry data that can be employed for the comparative study of different species and study sites. The same methodology can be used each time discrete records of animal detections of any nature are employed for estimating the site fidelity of an animal at different timescales.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,AUG 11,2015,101371journalpone0134002,"[Capello, Manuela; Dagorn, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,UMR MARBEC, Sete, France./[Capello, Manuela; Deneubourg, Jean-Louis] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Unit Social Ecol, Brussels, Belgium./[Robert, Marianne] IFREMER, Fishery Technol & Biol Lab, F-56100 Lorient, France./[Soria, Marc; Potin, Gael] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,UMR MARBEC, St Denis, Reunion, France./[Itano, David; Holland, Kim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA.","Capello, M (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, IRD,UMR MARBEC, Sete, France.",10_1371_journal_pone_0134002

To overcome this problem, we developed a high-frequency acceleration data-logger that can be triggered by a manually defined acceleration threshold, thus allowing the selective measurement of burst movements. We conducted experiments under laboratory and field conditions to examine the performance of the logger. The laboratory experiment using red seabream (Pagrus major) showed that the new logger could measure the kinematics of their escape behaviors.

During such raids ants lay pheromones to form trails for others to find a food source. In this work a coupled PDE/ODE model is introduced to study ant dynamics and pheromone concentration. The key idea is the introduction of two forms of ant dynamics: foraging and returning, each governed by different environmental and social cues. The model accounts for all aspects of the raiding cycle including local collisional interactions, the laying of pheromone along a trail, and the transition from one class of ants to another. Through analysis of an order parameter measuring the orientational order in the system, the model shows self-organization into a collective state consisting of lanes of ants moving in opposite directions as well as the transition back to the individual state once the food source is depleted matching prior experimental results. This indicates that in the absence of direct communication ants naturally form an efficient method for transporting food to the nest/bivouac. The model exhibits a continuous kinetic phase transition in the order parameter as a function of certain system parameters.

During their trips, however, animals are likely to encounter physical heterogeneities that guide their movements and, as a result, influence their spatial distribution. In this paper, we develop a statistical model of individual movement in a bounded space. We introduced cockroaches in a circular arena and quantified accurately the behaviors underlying their movement in a finite space. Close to the edges, we considered that the animals exhibit a linear movement mode with a constant probability per unit time to leave the edge and enter the central zone of the arena. Far from the walls cockroaches were assumed to move according to a diffusive random walk which enabled us to overcome the inherent problem of the quantification of the turning angle distribution. A numerical model implementing the behavioral rules derived from our experiments, confirms that the pattern of the spatial distribution of animals observed can be reliably accounted for by wall-following behaviors combined with a diffusive random walk. The approach developed in this study can be applied to model the movements of animals in various environment under consideration of spatial structure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

fish; coastal environment","Eutrophication and associated occurrence of hypoxic condition could cause significant damage to marine ecosystems, resulting in considerable economic losses to fisheries and aquaculture and is a major source of stress that fish often have to contend with in order to survive. This problem is likely to be exacerbated in the coming years, since the wastewater treatment facilities is unlikely to catch up with increasing human activities. Moreover, large-scale reclamation projects in coastal areas have recently been increased, and these activities certainly have adverse impacts on water quality and fisheries resources. Coastal construction has a significant role in the development of hypoxic water by changing the current and mixing pattern of water. Changes in species composition and decreases in species richness and diversity have been well documented in hypoxic systems. Hypoxia could cause endocrine disruption in fish and eliminate populations of sensitive species. Shallow coastal areas are of great importance for the special nursery of fish and shellfish and land reclamation in these areas cause strong damage to fisheries. Although the tolerance of aquatic life to hypoxia is known, there is no information about the mortality of fish caused by hypoxia because fish can swim around it and no modeling study has yet been carried out. Criteria that influence the movement of fish are: amounts of food, water temperature and depth, dissolved oxygen concentration and nature of seabed. However, among these, water temperature and dissolved oxygen are the most crucial parameters that affect survival, movement and growth of fish. In this paper, a model of fish preference and mortality for environmental conditions was developed and applied to the Hakata Bay where hypoxic water occurs every summer. For the purpose of this study, a field survey of fish behavior under hypoxic water was conducted by releasing marbled sale (Pleuronectes yokohamae) in the inner bay. Moreover, a series of preference tests for DO, salinity and temperature in the laboratory were conducted in order to decide preference parameters of fish. Using the results of both field and laboratory studies, a sub-module of fish preference and mortality was coded within an integrated hydrothermal and eutrophication model (CHEM) to predict the behavior and mortality of marbled sale when hypoxia would occur in the bay. The model could reasonably simulate the behavior of the fish under hypoxia. An assessment of the impact of the ongoing land reclamation project of about 401 ha. in the Wajiro tidal flat zones at the head of the bay on the fisheries resources was also conducted using the model. The results showed that the artificial land lowered the mortality rate of fish under hypoxic condition in the bay during the summer period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is split into two successive time phases, the sticking and the slipping phases, and uses a mechanical description of the human finger's behavior. The parameters of the model are identified through measurements of the finger/string displacements during the interaction. The validity of the model is verified using a configurable and repeatable robotic finger, enhanced with a silicone layer. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of the model's parameters on the free oscillations of the string. As a result, a direct implementation of the model produces an accurate simulation of a string response to a given finger motion, as compared to experimental data. The set of parameters that govern the plucking action is divided into two groups: Parameters controlled by the harpist and parameters intrinsic to the plucking. The former group and to a lesser extent the latter highly influence the initial conditions of the string vibrations. The simulations of the string's free oscillations highlight the large impact the model parameters have on the sound produced and therefore allows the understanding of how different players on the same instrument can produce a specific/personal sound quality.

The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincare maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is 'off' when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is 'on' otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains ( P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUL 8,2009,101371journalpone0006169,NA,"Asai, Y (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Ctr Adv Med Engn & Informat, Osaka, Japan.",10_1371_journal_pone_0006169

Animal migration has long intrigued scientists and wildlife managers alike, yet migratory species face increasing challenges because of habitat fragmentation, climate change and over-exploitation. Central to the understanding migratory species is the objective discrimination between migratory and nonmigratory individuals in a given population, quantifying the timing, duration and distance of migration and the ability to predict migratory movements.
2. Here, we propose a uniform statistical framework to (i) separate migration from other movement behaviours, (ii) quantify migration parameters without the need for arbitrary cut-off criteria and (iii) test predictability across individuals, time and space.
3. We first validated our novel approach by simulating data based on established theoretical movement patterns. We then formulated the expected shapes of squared displacement patterns as nonlinear models for a suite of movement behaviours to test the ability of our method to distinguish between migratory movement and other movement types.
4. We then tested our approached empirically using 108 wild Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared moose Alces alces in Scandinavia as a study system because they exhibit a wide range of movement behaviours, including resident, migrating and dispersing individuals, within the same population. Applying our approach showed that 87% and 67% of our Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, respectively, can be classified as migratory.
5. Using nonlinear mixed effects models for all migratory individuals we showed that the distance, timing and duration of migration differed between the sexes and between years, with additional individual differences accounting for a large part of the variation in the distance of migration but not in the timing or duration. Overall, the model explained most of the variation (92%) and also had high predictive power for the same individuals over time (69%) as well as between study populations (74%).
6.

The model successfully simulated the observed transport patterns during the egg and larval stages and the northward migrations during the juvenile stage in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The model results showed that both temperature during the larval stage in the Kuroshio Extension and the prey availability during the early juvenile stage in the KuroshioOyashio transitional area are important factors for growth of Japanese sardine. In autumn, the observed juvenile sardine were mainly distributed in the subarctic water region off the Kuril Islands, which is an area (158165 degrees E, 4347 degrees N) with a high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. The model reproduced the fish distribution, which has a high density in this region.

The Vicsek model and its new versions explained such collective behavior of self-propelled agents with the mechanism of un-weighted influence of neighbors and global visual field (GVF), which may not always fit the reality. In the present work, we take both exponential (lambda) neighbor weight (ENW) and restricted visual field (RVF) into account, and investigate the combinatory effect of them. Based on this mechanism, in most cases of our simulation, stationary direction consensus V-a exhibits a maximum or decreases with VF, and a minimum convergence time T-min, appears in RVF, which demonstrates that GVF is not necessary for coordinated motion, while RVF matched ENW would be reasonable. Moreover, we simulated various recipes for optimizing V-a and T in unfavorable cases, and found critical points separating inverse lambda-dependent variations of T. The present work may be useful in improving the efficiency of direction consensus of large flocks of artificial individuals besides the understanding of biological collective motion in nature.

Examining monumentality in different environmental and economic settings can reveal diverse reasons for people to form larger social units and express unity through architectural display. In multiple areas of Africa, monumentality developed as mobile herders created large cemeteries and practiced other forms of commemoration. The motives for such behavior in sparsely populated, unpredictable landscapes may differ from well-studied cases of monumentality in predictable environments with sedentary populations. Here we report excavations and ground-penetrating radar surveys at the earliest and most massive monumental site in eastern Africa.

People of diverse ages and both sexes were buried, and ornaments accompanied most individuals. There is no evidence for social stratification. The uncertainties of living on a ""moving frontier"" of early herding-exacerbated by dramatic environmental shifts-may have spurred people to strengthen social networks that could provide information and assistance.

Existing methods for linking wildlife movement to remotely sensed landscape data generally rely on the application of subjectively derived distance thresholds to represent proximity (i.e., near or far) relative to disturbance, thereby possibly limiting the scope of research questions and insight gained. We develop an alternative method based on semivariogram modeling that quantifies consistency in movement parameters as a function of distance to disturbance features. Our approach uses movement data to identify spatially explicit scales of wildlife response to linear features. We illustrate the benefit of movement-driven approaches for generating hypotheses about wildlife movement with grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) movement data. We concentrate specifically on building hypotheses to explain how seasonal mortality is linked to near road movements. The movement-driven method demonstrated consistency in step length (i.e., spatial scales of response) ranging from 35 m-90 m from roads, depending on age, sex, and season. Given this pattern, our data suggest a minimum vegetation buffer of 90 m to serve as screening cover along roadsides to improve survival in this ecosystem. More broadly, our generalizable method can identify definitive spatial scales of response around human disturbance features in any wildlife system, thereby providing managers with movement-driven insight to reduce impacts on wildlife in multi-use landscapes.

The Global Positioning System provides relatively continuous animal tracking over time and long distances. Nevertheless, the continuous trajectory of an animal's movement is usually only observed at discrete time points. Brownian bridge models have been used to model movement of an animal between two observed locations within a reasonably short time interval. Assuming that animals are in perpetual motion, these models ignore inactivity such as resting or sleeping. Using the latest developments in applied probability, we propose a moving-resting process model where an animal is assumed to alternate between a moving state, during which it moves in a Brownian motion, and a resting state, during which it does not move. Theoretical properties of the process are studied as a first step towards more realistic models for animal movements. Analytic expressions are derived for the distribution of one increment and two consecutive increments, and are validated with simulations. The induced bridge model conditioning on the starting and end points is used to compute an animal's probability of occurrence in an observation area during the time of observation, which has wide applications in wildlife behavior research.",SPRINGER JAPAN KK,APR,2014,101007s1014401304288,"[Yan, Jun; Chen, Yung-wei; Pozdnyakov, Vladimir] Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA./[Yan, Jun; Ortega, Isaac M.; Meyer, Thomas] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT USA./[Lawrence-Apfel, Kirstin; Ortega, Isaac M.; Meyer, Thomas] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Storrs, CT USA./[Williams, Scott] Connecticut Agr Expt Stn, Dept Hort & Forestry, New Haven, CT 06504 USA.","Yan, J (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Stat, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",10_1007_s10144_013_0428_8

In this paper, we tested that hypothesis using 152 radio-collared European hares in a harvested population. We developed a multi-event capture-recapture model, combining telemetry data and recoveries and separately modeling the foray probability, the settlement probability, and the permanent dispersal probability. The parameterization introduced here raises the possibility of separately testing effects on survival and dispersal probabilities at each stage of dispersal (departure, transience, and settlement). In accordance with our expectations, we reveal that dispersers incur higher mortality risks during transience and the early settlement period than philopatric individuals or settled dispersers. We also found that dispersers suffer from higher risks of being shot. Those results illustrate that unfamiliarity with the habitat during transience makes dispersal costly and that settled dispersers may enjoy survival rates comparable to those of philopatric individuals. Surprisingly, we also found that individuals have a higher probability of foraying during the hunting season. We suggest that hunting and related disturbances increase dispersal costs both by increasing mortality risk during transience and (perhaps) by increasing movement rates.

LA-ICPMS data reflected the ontogenetic movements of C. leucas from natal habitats. Differences among adults were gender related. Shifts in habitat use by subadults were correlated with a sigmoidal delta C-13 relationship with TL.

Methods We used two types of locational data (distance sampling detections and GPS collar locations), and three modeling methods (negative binomial regression, logistic regression, and Maxent), to generate resource selection functions (RSFs) and define resistance surfaces. We compared two corridor detection algorithms (cost-distance and circuit theory), to delineate corridors. We validated corridors by comparing random and wildebeest locations that fell within corridors, and cross-validated by data type.
Results Both data types produced similar RSFs. Wildebeest consistently selected migration habitat in flatter terrain farther from human settlements. Validation indicated three of the combinations of data type, modeling, and corridor detection algorithms (detection data with Maxent modeling, GPS collar data with logistic regression modeling, and GPS collar data with Maxent modeling, all using cost-distance) far outperformed the other seven. We merged the predictive corridors from these three data-method combinations to reveal habitat with highest probability of use.
Conclusions The use of multiple methods ensures that planning is able to prioritize conservation of migration corridors based on all available information.",SPRINGER,AUG,2017,101007s1098001705374,"[Bond, Monica L.; Lee, Derek E.] Wild Nat Inst, 15 North Main St Suite 208, Concord, NH 03302 USA./[Bradley, Curtis M.] Ctr Biol Div, POB 710, Tucson, AZ 85701 USA./[Kiffner, Christian] Ctr Wildlife Management Studies, Sch Field Studies, POB 304, Karatu, Tanzania./[Morrison, Thomas A.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.","Bond, ML (reprint author), Wild Nat Inst, 15 North Main St Suite 208, Concord, NH 03302 USA.",10_1007_s10980_017_0537_4

Connectivity models provide practical tools for assessing fragmentation effects and developing mitigation or conservation responses. To be useful to conservation practitioners, connectivity models need to incorporate multiple scales and include realistic scenarios based on potential changes to habitat and anthropogenic pressures. This will help to prioritize conservation efforts in a changing landscape.
The goal of our paper was to evaluate differences in population connectivity for lions (Panthera leo) across the Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area (KAZA) under different landscape change scenarios and a range of dispersal distances.
We used an empirically optimized resistance surface, based on analysis of movement pathways of dispersing lions in southern Africa to calculate resistant kernel connectivity. We assessed changes in connectivity across nine landscape change scenarios, under each of which we explored the behavior of lions with eight different dispersal abilities.
Our results demonstrate that reductions in the extent of the protected area network and/or fencing protected areas will result in large declines in the extent of population connectivity, across all modeled dispersal abilities. Creation of corridors or erection of fences strategically placed to funnel dispersers between protected areas increased overall connectivity of the population.
Our results strongly suggest that the most effective means of maintaining long-term population connectivity of lions in the KAZA region involves retaining the current protected area network, augmented with protected corridors or strategic fencing to direct dispersing individuals towards suitable habitat and away from potential conflict areas.",SPRINGER,AUG,2016,101007s1098001502923,"[Cushman, Samuel A.] USDA Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, 2500 S Pine Knoll Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA./[Elliot, Nicholas B.; Macdonald, David W.; Loveridge, Andrew J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.","Macdonald, DW (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Tubney OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",10_1007_s10980_015_0292_3

We applied a nonlinear model to frequent locations collected with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by caribou found in forested and alpine (above tree line) habitats. We differentiated intra- from interpatch movements and identified collections of patches (multiple-patch scale) where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. On average, intra- and interpatch movements were 450.7 and 1268.8 m, respectively, and multiple-patch movements occurred over an area of 182 ha. Intrapatch movements were highly correlated, indicative of a strong relationship between behavior and place. Caribou in the forest selected patches of Pine terrace, whereas caribou in the alpine selected patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover. Predation risk was not a factor influencing movements of caribou at the intrapatch scale. Selection of cover types was more variable during interpatch movements. At that scale, caribou selected patches of Pine terrace, Lakes/rivers, Alpine-little vegetative cover, and Alpine-grass. The routes selected by caribou had lower energetic costs relative to surrounding terrain, and during some winters, caribou were subjected to higher levels of predation risk during those movements. At the multiple-patch scale, selection was more specific and encompassed patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover, Alpine-grass, and Pine terrace. Predation risk was relatively unimportant at the multi-patch scale, but animals that moved from forested to alpine habitats reduced their relative risk of predation. Patch configuration was a poor predictor of those areas where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. There was some evidence of caribou selecting patches of Pine terrace within a matrix of Wetlands and Pine-black spruce/black spruce patches. Caribou in the alpine avoided patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover adjacent to forest types. Our results indicate that forest managers should maintain widely distributed patches of Pine terrace and implement silvicultural regimes that do not stimulate predator populations across areas used for interpatch movements.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,DEC,2002,1023073099941,"Univ No British Columbia, Fac Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada./British Colombia Minist Environm Lands & Pks, Prince George, BC V2L 3H9, Canada.","Johnson, CJ (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, 2907 Biol Sci Ctr, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",NA

However, the way in which source habitats are identified and prioritized can reduce the effectiveness of conservation actions. Although sources and sinks are conceptually defined using both demographic and movement criteria, simplifications are often required in systems with limited data. To assess the conservation outcomes of alternative source metrics and resulting prioritizations, we simulated population dynamics and extinction risk for 3 endangered species. Using empirically based habitat population models, we linked habitat maps with measured site- or habitat-specific demographic conditions, movement abilities, and behaviors. We calculated source-sink metrics over a range of periods of data collection and prioritized consistently high-output sources for conservation. We then tested whether prioritized patches identified the habitats that most affected persistence by removing them and measuring the population response. Conservation decisions based on different source-sink metrics and durations of data collection affected species persistence. Shorter time series obscured the ability of metrics to identify influential habitats, particularly in temporally variable and slowly declining populations. Data-rich source-sink metrics that included both demography and movement information did not always identify the habitats with the greatest influence on extinction risk. In some declining populations, patch abundance better predicted influential habitats for short-term regional persistence. Because source-sink metrics (i.e., births minus deaths; births and immigrations minus deaths and emigration) describe net population conditions and cancel out gross population counts, they may not adequately identify influential habitats in declining populations. For many nonequilibrium populations, new metrics that maintain the counts of individual births, deaths, and movement may provide additional insight into habitats that most influence persistence.",WILEY,JUN,2018,101111cobi13058,"[Heinrichs, Julie A.; Lawler, Joshua J.; Wilsey, Chad B.; Monroe, Kira C.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, POB 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./[Heinrichs, Julie A.; Monroe, Kira C.; Aldridge, Cameron L.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA./[Schumaker, Nathan H.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","Heinrichs, JA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, POB 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Heinrichs, JA (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",10_1111_cobi_13058

Ninety-two participants (14-83 years) wore acceleration sensors on the sternum and right thigh while spending the night in their natural environment and following their normal routine. Physical activity, body posture, and change in body posture during the night were classified using a newly developed classification algorithm based on angular changes of body axes. The duration of supine posture and objective indicators of sleep quality showed convergent validity with self-reports of sleep duration and quality as well as external validity regarding expected age differences. The algorithms for classifying sleep postures and posture changes very reliably distinguished postures with 99.7% accuracy.

How animals respond to anthropogenic disturbances is a core component of conservation biology and how they respond to predators and competitors is equally of central importance to wildlife ecology. Camera traps have rapidly become a critical tool in wildlife research by providing a fully automated means of observing animals without needing an observer present, permitting data to be collected on rare or elusive species and infrequent events. Snapshots from camera traps revealing a species' presence have been the principal data used to date to gauge behaviour; but, lacking experimental controls, such data permit only correlational analyses potentially open to confounding effects. Playback experiments provide a powerful means to directly test the behavioural responses of animals, enabling strong inferences and rigorous conclusions not subject to the potential confounds affecting the interpretation of snapshot data; the principal factor to date limiting the use of playback experiments being the need to have an observer present.
2. We developed an Automated Behavioural Response system (ABR) comprising a custom-built motion-sensitive speaker system that can be paired with any commercially available camera trap, providing the means to conduct playback experiments directly testing the behavioural responses of any species that can be 'caught' on a camera trap.
3. We describe field tests in Uganda, Canada and the USA, experimentally testing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances and interactions among large carnivores, in species as diverse as elephants, black bears, chimpanzees and cougars; experiments that would be completely infeasible without the ABR. We evaluate factors affecting the rate of successful data collection in the experiments in Uganda and Canada, and detail how we maximized the system's performance in the USA experiment.
4. By integrating the power playback experiments provide to directly and rigorously test behavioural responses with the capacity camera trapping affords to study virtually any animal anywhere, the ABR can both greatly expand the range of research questions addressed by conservation biologists and wildlife ecologists and qualitatively improve the rigour of the resulting conclusions.

The collar is interactive and can receive SMS commands, for instance, to adjust the interval at which location information is transmitted. We tested the method in experiments in which people equipped with GPS-GSM mobile phones approached a GPS-GSM-collared bear.

Above the level of the school structure, clusters are observed the nature of which has not been definitively determined. We hypothesized that these clusters corresponded to a materialisation of the microcohorts originating from successive spawnings of fish populations in their vital domain.
A candidate individual-based model was developed to investigate this hypothesis. This model is based on pattern-oriented modelling of a concrete documented case: the dynamics of the round sardinella (Sardinella aunita) population living off the West African coasts and subject to environmental fluctuations caused by seasonal upwelling. The simulated agents were round sardinella microcohorts situated and moving in a discretised physical environment. The combined effects of environmental forcing (temperature, wind, retention) and inner biological dynamics (reproduction, growth and mortality, competition) condition the dynamics of this population.
The modelled behaviour generated realistic dynamic patterns (population distribution, spawning zones, periods and plasticity, biomass fluctuations), which were obtained simultaneously and successfully compared with observations. The steady-state number of microcohorts obtained after simulation convergence was similar to the number of clusters observed in situ in this area for this population.
The realism and diversity of the patterns simultaneously simulated suggested the cluster-microcohort equivalence hypothesis as a candidate framework accounting for the origin of the clusters observed in situ. Within this preliminary exploration, we discuss the consistency of the hypothesis and the accuracy of the model. If the correspondence between clusters and microcohorts proves to be real, it may be transient and progressively modified by other environmental factors. If stable over time, as simulated in the model, the number of observed clusters should be related to the number of spawning events in the species' lifetime. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous technologies have relied upon techniques with very low spatial or temporal resolution, such as VHF telemetry. Rather incongruously, therefore, relatively simple underground activity regimes have often been assumed, with insufficient attention to the ecological importance of burrow use. We test the capability of Magneto-Inductive (MI) tracking, recording underground movement within a European badger sett over a 2week period in February. These data allowed us to: quantify subterranean movement; extrapolate the three-dimensional burrow architecture; simultaneously track multiple individuals; and establish the function of specific movement patterns; demonstrating the technique's utility. Contrasting data generated using MI tracking, against the resolution achievable with VHF tracking, we establish how sampling frequency can influence the perception of movement. Taking 20 locational fixes per minute, MI collars operated for 1year before on-board batteries failed, resulting in an average five billion data points per collar deployment. Socio-ecologically we found that rather than foraging continuously throughout the night, badgers returned to the sett an average of 22 times, approximately every 3-4h. From burrow mapping, badgers tended to use peripheral chambers for c. 45min on these return visits. These outlying chambers were used less by day, when badgers selected deeper chambers, suggesting each chamber type fulfils a different function. This technology also exposed that badgers exhibited a far greater extent of underground movement than revealed by former technologies, which by comparison captured <05% of subterranean activity. Importantly, these high-resolution data showed that individuals left, returned to, and moved about the sett independently, with no tendency for synchronous subterranean activity. In overview, Magneto-Inductive tracking proved relatively simple and cost-effective to deploy, it provided very detailed and accurate subterranean fixes, and was robust enough for long-term field deployment. Furthermore, the capabilities of MI are highly transferable, enabling a better understanding of underground activity and the ecological importance of subterranean burrows for the conservation and management of a wide range of species.",WILEY,MAY,2015,1011112041210X12348,"[Noonan, Michael J.; Newman, Chris; Buesching, Christina D.; Ellwood, Stephen A.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England./[Markham, Andrew; Trigoni, Niki] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford OX1 3QD, England.","Macdonald, DW (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House,Abingdon Rd, Abingdon OX13 5QL, Oxon, England.",NA

In this paper, we develop a new method to elucidate animal movement patterns from tracking data. Here, we propose the notion of continuous behavior patterns as a concise representation of popular migration routes and underlying sequential behaviors during migration. Each stage in the pattern is characterized in terms of space (i.e., the places traversed during movements) and time (i.e. the time spent in those places); that is, the behavioral state corresponding to a stage is inferred according to the spatiotemporal and sequential context. Hence, the pattern may be interpreted predictably. We develop a candidate generation and refinement framework to derive all continuous behavior patterns from raw trajectories. In the framework, we first define the representative spots to denote the underlying potential behavioral states that are extracted from individual trajectories according to the similarity of relaxed continuous locations in certain distinct time intervals. We determine the common behaviors of multiple individuals according to the spatiotemporal proximity of representative spots and apply a projection-based extension approach to generate candidate sequential behavior sequences as candidate patterns. Finally, the candidate generation procedure is combined with a refinement procedure to derive continuous behavior patterns. We apply an ordered processing strategy to accelerate candidate refinement. The proposed patterns and discovery framework are evaluated through conceptual experiments on both real GPS-tracking and large synthetic datasets.",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,MAY 3,2016,1.01080136588162E+024,"[Wang, Yuwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China./[Wang, Yuwei; Luo, Ze; Xiong, Yan; Yan, Baoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Comp Network Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China./[Takekawa, John; Spragens, Kyle] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Vallejo, CA USA./[Takekawa, John] Natl Audubon Soc, Div Sci, San Francisco, CA USA./[Prosser, Diann] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Beltsville, MD USA./[Newman, Scott] UN, EMPRES Wildlife Hlth & Ecol Unit, Anim Prod & Hlth Div, FAO, Rome, Italy./[Xiao, Xiangming] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Ctr Spatial Anal, Norman, OK 73019 USA./[Batbayar, Nyambayar] Wildlife Sci & Conservat Ctr, Ulaanbaatar, Mongol Peo Rep./[Balachandran, Sivananinthaperumal] Bombay Nat Hist Soc, Hornbill House, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.","Luo, Z (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Comp Network Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",10_1080_13658816_2015_1091462

In this study on dairy cattle we validated a new method for automatic 24 h recording of behavioural activity, the Actiwatch(R) activity monitoring system (ANIS). The ANIS is a very compact (27 turn x 26 mm x 9 mm, 16 g) accelerometer developed for long-term activity monitoring (e.g. 45 days at 1 min interval; 64 KB memory). The AMS devices were attached to the hind leg of 12 dairy cows, and recordings of activity were taken at I min interval for 10 consecutive days. ANIS recordings were compared with video recordings taken on five simultaneous days in order to investigate first, whether specific behavioural activities could be distinguished by the ANIS, and second, which behavioural activities could be differentiated. The consistency between devices was examined by comparing the recordings of two AMS devices attached to the same leg. The effect of positional application was tested by attaching a device to both the left and right hind leg. In order to distinguish statistically between the different levels of activity obtained from the AMS recordings dynamic thresholds were determined. High and low activity counts were then calculated using these thresholds. The activity counts were highly correlated with the behavioural patterns derived from video recordings (high activity: r(s) = 0.75, P < 0.001; low activity: r(s) = 0.65, P < 0.001). The mean number of low activity bouts (NBLA) calculated from the AMS recordings and the mean number of lying bouts (NBLY) derived from the video recordings agreed completely (mean NBLA and mean NBLY both equal to 7.8). This result and the mean duration of NBLA (upper AMS: 57.4 min, lower AMS: 59.0 min) correspond strongly with the findings of other studies of the resting behaviour of dairy cows. The recordings from two AMS devices (upper AMS; lower AMS) attached to the same leg (r(s) from 0.70 to 0.99, all P < 0.001) showed higher correlation coefficients compared to the recordings from two AMS devices attached to different legs (r(s) from 0.60 to 0.87, all P < 0.001). In conclusion, the results suggest that the ANIS can be used to reliably measure objectively different levels of behavioural activity in dairy cows, and also the temporal organisation of the different activity levels without any restriction of the animal's freedom of movement.

The greater complexity of dive revealed through modern, high resolution data highlights the need to re-assess this approach and to consider a larger number of phases within individual dives. Two southern elephant seals (SES) were fitted with a head mounted Time Depth Recorder (TDR) and an accelerometer from which prey capture attempts were estimated. A Weddell seal was also fitted with a TDR. TDRs for both species recorded depth once per second. We quantified the within dive behaviour using an automated broken stick algorithm identifying the optimal number of segments within each dive. The vertical sinuosity of the segments was used to infer two types of behaviours, with highly sinuous segments indicating ""hunting"" and less sinuous segments indicating ""transiting"". Using the broken stick method the seals alternated between ""hunting"" and ""transit"" modes with an average of 6 +/- 2 and 7 +/- 0.02 behavioural phases within each dive for the Weddell seal and SES, respectively. In SES, 77% of prey capture attempts (identified from the acceleration data) occurred in highly sinuous phases (""hunting'') as defined by our new approach. SES spent more time in transit mode within a dive, and hunting mostly occurred during the bottom phase. Conversely the Weddell seal spent more time in hunting mode which also occurred during bottom phase but occurred mostly at shallower depths. Such differences probably reflect different foraging tactics and habitat use. For both species, hunting time differs significantly from bottom time previously used as a proxy for the time spent foraging in a dive. The hunting time defined by our method therefore provides a more accurate fine-scale description of the seals' foraging behaviour.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 12,2014,101371journalpone0099329,"[Heerah, Karine; Charrassin, Jean-Benoit] MNHN, IRD, CNRS, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, Paris, France./[Heerah, Karine; Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia./[Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia./[Guinet, Christophe] Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France.","Heerah, K (reprint author), MNHN, IRD, CNRS, Lab Oceanog & Climat Experimentat & Approches Num, Paris, France.",10_1371_journal_pone_0099329

The measure is a generalisation of the 'Straightness Index', the ratio of the beeline distance between the start and end of a track to the total distance travelled. In our new measure, the Straightness Index is computed repeatedly for track segments at all possible temporal scales. The MSSI offers advantages over the standard Straightness Index, and other simple measures of track tortuosity (such as Sinuosity and Fractal Dimension), because it provides multiple characterisations of straightness, rather than just a single summary measure. Thus, comparisons can be made among different segments of trajectories and changes in behaviour can be inferred, both over time and at different temporal granularities. The measure also has an important advantage over several recent and increasingly popular methods for detecting behavioural changes in time-series locational data (e.g., state-space models and positional entropy methods), in that it is extremely simple to compute. Here, we demonstrate use of the MSSI on both synthetic and real animal-movement trajectories. We show how behavioural changes can be inferred within individual tracks and how behaviour varies across spatio-temporal scales. Our aim is to present a useful tool for researchers requiring a computationally simple but effective means of analysing the movement patterns of animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a new device, the Human Interfaced Personal Observation Platform (HIPOP), which is a head-mounted (typically on a hat) unit that logs magnetometry and accelerometry data at high rates and, following appropriate calibration, can be used to determine the heading and pitch of the wearer's head. We used this device on participants visiting a botanical garden and noted that although head pitch ranged between -80 degrees and 60 degrees, 25% confidence limits were restricted to an arc of about 25 degrees with a tendency for the head to be pitched down (mean head pitch ranged between -43 degrees and 0 degrees). Mean rates of change of head pitch varied between -0.00187 degrees/0.1 s and 0.0018 degrees/0.1 s, markedly slower than rates of change of head heading which varied between -0.3141 degrees/0.1 s and 0.01263 degrees/0.1 s although frequency distributions of both parameters showed them to be symmetrical and monomodal. Overall, there was considerable variation in both head pitch and head heading, which highlighted the role that head orientation might play in exposing people to certain features of the environment. Thus, when used in tandem with accurate position-determining systems, the HIPOP can be used to determine how the head is orientated relative to gravity and geographic North and in relation to geographic position, presenting data on how the environment is being 'framed' by people in relation to environmental content.",PEERJ INC,JUN 18,2015,107717peerj908,"[Wilson, Gwendoline Ixia; Grundy, Ed; Wilson, Vianney; Wilson, Rory P.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Swansea Lab Anim Movement, Biosci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Holton, Mark D.] Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Walker, James; Jones, Mark W.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Comp Sci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Davies, Ian M.] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Math, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Clarke, David; Luckman, Adrian] Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geog, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Russill, Nick] TerraDat, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales./[Plummer, Rosie] Natl Bot Garden Wales, Llanarthne, Camarthen, Wales.","Wilson, RP (reprint author), Swansea Univ, Coll Sci, Swansea Lab Anim Movement, Biosci, Singleton Pk, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",10_7717_peerj_908

A new method of attaching motion-sensitive tags securely to large sharks is presented which allows free-swimming animals to be equipped without any form of restraint. The system was tested on 11 free-swimming whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Devices were placed on one of two elongated arms emanating from a torsion spring which acted to force the arms together. The system was clamped to the second dorsal fin using a specially designed tagging-gun operated manually by a snorkeller. Each arm was equipped with two 1.5 cm-long spikes to ensure stable, firm attachment to the fin. Data from the deployments showed that response to the tagging event varied between individuals, with some sharks showing no obvious reaction, while others exhibited a substantial reaction. Clamps remained stable on the sharks throughout the entire duration of all trials. The whole system was fitted with a corroding magnesium link to ensure that the clamp would release from the shark within weeks of deployment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this scenario, the most significant sign of being alive is the respiratory motions, which is hidden in parameters of the returned signal. This signal, whose statistical characteristics are generally nonstationary, is mixed with both stationary and nonstationary clutters and white and colored noise. In this paper, in an analytical way, the returned signal has been addressed by the Fourier series model with time-varying coefficients, as a fitting model. Then, based on the unconditional orthonormal representation of band-limited signals, a minimum mean square error estimator is introduced to determine the time-varying coefficients of the Fourier series. Using the new representation of the Fourier coefficients, a new approach is suggested that enables us to extract parameters of the respiration in very low signal-to-noise-and-clutter ratio (SNCR) conditions in the presence of both stationary and nonstationary clutters. Getting the most out of the estimator, this approach alleviates the problems associated with clutters and noise, without resorting to match filtering. Hence, a robust and blind respiratory-motion detection (RMD) from stationary or nonstationary received signal is obtained.

Until now, however, no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector, based on the measurement of acceleration, has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking, tobogganing, standing on land, lying on land, resting at the water surface, porpoising and diving. To illustrate the potential of this new technique, we compared the behaviour of Adelie penguins during the chick-rearing period in a fast sea-ice region and an ice-free region. The proportion of time spent standing, lying on land and walking during foraging trips was greater for penguins in the sea-ice region (37.6+/-13.3 % standing, 21.6+/-15.6 % lying and 5.9+6.3 % walking) than for those in the ice-free region (12.0+/-15.8 % standing, 0.38+/-0.60 % lying and 0 % walking), whereas the proportion of time spent resting at the water surface and porpoising was greater for birds in the ice-free region (38.1+/-6.4% resting and 1.1+/-1.1 % porpoising) than for those in the sea-ice region (3.0+/-2.3 % resting and 0 % porpoising; means +/- S.D., N = 7 for the sea-ice region, N = 4 for the ice-free region). Using this new approach, further studies combining the monitoring of marine resources in different Antarctic sites and the measurement of the energy expenditure of foraging penguins, e.g., using heart rates, will constitute a powerful tool for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on their foraging strategy.

In order to remedy this, we developed a new technique using a motion detector (acceleration data-logger) for monitoring the activity and behaviour of free-ranging vertebrates and tested its efficiency on a domestic cat, Felis catus. A total of 3615 min of surging acceleration was measured along the longitudinal body axis of an adult male cat. The cat's behaviour was also filmed for 113 min, these video data being used to correlate the logger's signals with the cat's behaviour. Acceleration data-loggers attached on the cat's collar recorded acceleration signals which were influenced by both the gravitational acceleration resulting from the body posture and the dynamic acceleration resulting from the dynamic behaviour of the cat. By applying spectral analysis based on a fast Fourier Transform to acceleration signals, body postures and some of the dynamic behaviours of the cat such as drinking, eating, and several paces of travelling were efficiently determined. The present study shows that acceleration data-loggers represent a useful and reliable system for accurately recording the activities and detail behaviours of the terrestrial animals.

To scale-up from individual foraging behaviour to processes occurring at the population scale, one needs to sample foraging behaviour at the individual level, and over large temporal scales or during critical seasons known to influence life-history traits. We developed an innovative technique to monitor foraging behaviour at the individual level in secretive species, a technique that can be ultimately used to investigate the links between foraging behaviour and life-history traits. First, the technique used a novel approach, namely the combination of telemetry tracking and biomarking of faeces with food dyes to locate fresh signs of presence left by individuals equipped with GPS collars. Second, the technique is based on the simultaneous or successive sampling of life-history traits and individual foraging behaviour, using tracks with high probabilities of recovery of dyed faeces. We first describe our methodological approach, using a case study of a large herbivore, and then provide recommendations and guidelines for its use. Sampling single snow tracks of individuals equipped with a GPS collar was a reliable way to assess individual winter foraging behaviour in a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) population. During that period, the probability of recovery of dyed faeces within the range of the collar precision was very high for single snow tracks of equipped deer (97%). Our approach is well suited to study individual foraging behaviour, and could ultimately be used to investigate the interplay between intra-population heterogeneity in foraging behaviour, life-history traits, and demographic processes.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,NOV 16,2012,101371journalpone0049719,"[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Dussault, Christian; Tremblay, Jean-Pierre; Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, NSERC Prod Forestiers Anticosti Ind Res Chair, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada./[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Dussault, Christian; Tremblay, Jean-Pierre; Cote, Steeve D.] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ, Canada./[Dussault, Christian] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune, Direct Gen Expertise Faune & Ses Habitats, Quebec City, PQ, Canada./[Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Lecomte, Nicolas] Govt Nunavut, Dept Environm, Igloolik, NU, Canada.","Giroux, MA (reprint author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, NSERC Prod Forestiers Anticosti Ind Res Chair, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",10_1371_journal_pone_0049719

Each animal was held in a squeeze chute and given a 9-ml subcutaneous injection of doramectin, ivermectin or sterile saline. To separate the behavioral effects of needle insertion from the animal's reaction to each substance a 19-gauge butterfly needle with a 30-cm tube was used to prevent the pressure of the syringe from affecting the animal's behavior. Two observers, who were blind to the treatment, rated the behavioral reactions to the injections. The aversiveness of the injection was scored on a four number rating scale, 1 = no reaction, stood still, 2 = slight movement during injection, 3 = shaking the chute, and 4 = vigorous shaking. The cattle were also scored for willingness to re-enter the squeeze chute, Cattle in the doramectin group had significantly mon animals with a score of 1 compared to cattle injected with ivermectin. Re-entry scores into the chute were significantly different between treatments for one observer and not significantly different for the other observer. None of the products caused a sufficient nociceptive stimulus to prevent cattle from re-entering the squeeze chute. Doramectin causes significantly less discomfort during injection than ivermectin.

In the case of nocturnal animals this occurs when there is a full moon; however, the response of predators to the changes in their prey behaviour is relatively unknown. Two responses are possible: (1) increase in search effort to maintain food intake; or (2) decrease in distance travelled due to either: (a) an effort to conserve energy or (b) increased kill efficiency. Using GPS tracking collars we monitored the distances travelled (which is representative of search effort) by three maned wolves during the night of the full and new moon for five lunar cycles (during the dry season). A Wilcoxon matched-paired test showed that the maned wolves travelled significantly less during the full compared to the new moon (p < 0.05). On average, during the 10 It of darkness during a full moon maned wolves travelled 1.88 km less than on a new moon.

Up to one individual per second can be located, which supports data collection of large numbers of animals not possible with other methods. The laser system was used to track a halter-broken heifer led in an are beginning and ending about 50 m from the laser with a maximum distance of about 150 m. We recorded the location of the heifer at 35 points along the are using the laser, a global positioning system (GPS), and a nylon tape. There was an average linear difference of 1.16 m (S.D. 0.63) between the laser data and the GPS data. The laser was potentially more accurate than GPS for this application because the laser averaged only 0.21 m (S.D. 0.24) linear difference from the tape. Tests of the laser to relocate points in the field to within 0.20 m and 0.1 degrees, averaged 0.32 m (S.D. 0.29) from the original points.

Itching sensation and scratching are closely associated and thus scratching times are currently used for evaluating itching in animal models. However, objective measuring systems of scratching to assess the grade of dermatitis and the effectiveness of anti-pruritic drugs in animal dermatitis models are lacking. To investigate a quantitative evaluation system for itching, we have developed a novel acoustic scratching counting system and compared its accuracy with time-consuming slow-motion video recording system. We have also objectively evaluated the efficacy of an antihistamine using this novel system. Scratching behavior of an AD model mouse (K14 driven IL-18 transgenic mouse) was recorded visually and acoustically. Specific scratching sound produced by mice was recorded and counted using a software we have developed, and the results obtained using our acoustic system were not statistically different from data obtained using slow motion video system. Surprisingly, mice scratched more than 10 times/second, which was invisibly rapid motion and revealed inaccuracy of conventional hand counting system. Results were identical to that of measured by 10 times time costing slow-motion video analysis. The antihistamine is clearly effective for suppression of scratching as demonstrated using this objective and accurate method. This novel motion analysis system will open a window for physiological and pathological analysis for animal models and development of anti-pruritic drugs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, many snake species are so secretive that their density cannot be determined using traditional methods such as capture-mark-recapture. Thus, the status of most terrestrial snake populations remains completely unknown.
Aim. We developed a novel simulation-based technique for estimating density of secretive snakes that combined behavioural observations of snake road-crossing behaviour (crossing speed), effort-corrected road-survey data, and simulations of spatial movement patterns derived from radio-telemetry, without relying on mark recapture.
Methods. We used radio-telemetry data to parameterise individual-based movement models that estimate the frequency with which individual snakes cross roads and used information on survey vehicle speed and snake crossing speed to determine the probability of detecting a snake, given that it crosses the road transect during a survey. Snake encounter frequencies during systematic road surveys were then interpreted in light of detection probabilities and simulation model results to estimate snake densities and to assess various factors likely to affect abundance estimates. We demonstrated the broad applicability of this approach through a case study of the imperiled southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus) in the North Carolina (USA) Sandhills.
Key results. We estimated that H. simus occurs at average densities of 0.17 ha(-1) in the North Carolina Sandhills and explored the sensitivity of this estimate to assumptions and variation in model parameters.
Conclusions. Our novel method allowed us to generate the first abundance estimates for H. simus. We found that H. simus exists at low densities relative to congeners and other mid-sized snake species, raising concern that this species may not only have declined in geographic range, but may also occur at low densities or be declining in their strongholds, such as the North Carolina Sandhills.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,SEP,2018,101071WR16175,"[Willson, John A.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA./[Pittman, Shannon E.] Davidson Coll, Dept Biol, Davidson, NC 28035 USA./[Beane, Jeffrey C.] North Carolina State Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC 27601 USA./[Tuberville, Tracey A.] Univ Georgia, Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA.","Willson, JA (reprint author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",NA

Ecologists have developed methods for identifying the area(s) used by an animal (e.g., home range) and those used most intensely (utilization distribution) based on location data. However, few have extended these models beyond their traditional roles as descriptive 2D summaries of point data. Here we demonstrate how the home range method, T-LoCoH, can be expanded to quantify collective sampling coverage by multiple instrumented animals using grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) equipped with GPS tags and acoustic transceivers on the Scotian Shelf (Atlantic Canada) as a case study. At the individual level, we illustrate how time and space-use metrics quantifying individual sampling coverage may be used to determine the rate of acoustic transmissions received.
Results: Grey seals collectively sampled an area of 11,308 km(2) and intensely sampled an area of 31 km(2) from June-December. The largest area sampled was in July (2094.56 km(2)) and the smallest area sampled occurred in August (1259.80 km(2)), with changes in sampling coverage observed through time.
Conclusions: T-LoCoH provides an effective means to quantify changes in collective sampling effort by multiple instrumented animals and to compare these changes across time. We also illustrate how time and space-use metrics of individual instrumented seal movement calculated using T-LoCoH can be used to account for differences in the amount of time a bioprobe (biological sampling platform) spends in an area.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,NA,2015,101186s4046201500474,"[Baker, Laurie L.; Lidgard, Damian C.; Iverson, Sara J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada./[Flemming, Joanna E.

One hundred and fifty-two hours of continuous sampling showed that the duration of tail-up events lasted from a few seconds to 12 min and was longest in groups comprised of a single adult. The maximum duration of a recorded period that consistently included tail-up was 10 h; however, some individuals were observed to engage in the behavior at night and for four consecutive days. Tail-Lip movement speed did not vary by social class; however, it varied according to wind direction and speed.

Recent technical advances have given rise to new systems that present expanded opportunities for field research. We report the results of the first field test of Encounternet, a new digital radiotelemetry system comprising portable receiver stations and digital tags designed for long-term studies of the social behaviour and ecology of free-living animals. 2. We present results from a series of field tests designed to evaluate the utility of Encounternet for monitoring animals in a neotropical forest, with an emphasis on evaluating mate sampling behaviour in female long-tailed manakins. In this tropical species, females visit leks where males perform elaborate dances on horizontal perches. Females are highly cryptic in both plumage and activities, and therefore, Encounternet might provide unique insights into female behaviour and ecology. 3. Our first two tests revealed that pulse strength and probability of detection decrease with the distance between tag and receiver and that tags placed on a fixed perch near a receiver showed different patterns of reception than more distant tags. Our third test revealed that antenna angle had only a small influence on pulse strength. 4. Blind analysis of simulated bird movements confirmed that the Encounternet system provides reliable information on animal activity. Data from multiple receivers permitted accurate reconstruction of simulated bird movements. Tag detections showed low levels of false negatives and false positives. 5. Female manakins responded well to carrying Encounternet tags attached by an elastic leg harness. Birds flew well upon release and were detected for 7.5 +/- 0.8 days after release. Recaptures and re-sightings of females were rare in our large study population, yet there were two occasions where we confirmed that the tag fell off within 1 year. 6. We conclude that Encounternet technology provides an effective tool for monitoring animal ecology and behaviour. We show that it is capable of providing accurate measures of distance and that it is a highly versatile system for studying the ecology and behaviour of free-living animals.

A Novel Form of Behavioral Camouflage in Colubrid Snakes,1852,"Ryerson, William G.",COPEIA,NA,NA,"Different types of animal camouflage ultimately have one function: avoiding detection. The most common form of camouflage, background matching, involves color patterns that match the surrounding environment while the individual remains motionless. However, in a dynamic environment, movement could also contribute to camouflage. For example, reverse crypsis or motion dazzle employs color patterns that can disrupt the pattern of motion to aid in concealing an individual, or by making it more difficult to track the individual's movements. Here I describe a new form of behavioral camouflage in colubrid snakes. The behavior consists of a series of small, laterally oscillating movements. Observed in three colubrids (Thamnophis sirtalis, Thamnophis sauritus, Opheodrys vernalis), I hypothesize that this behavior serves to blend the dorsal patterning of a snake with moving vegetation. Through 73 observations in T. sirtalis, the head-wobble was only observed being performed by small snakes in grassy/reedy areas while the wind was active. In the case of both species of Thamnophis, this may match the movement of grass in the wind with the dorsal stripe on the snake, and help a snake avoid potential predators.",AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,JUL,2017,101643CH16500,"[Ryerson, William G.] St Anselm Coll, Biol Dept, 100 St Anselm Dr,Box 1742, Manchester, NH 03102 USA.","Ryerson, WG (reprint author), St Anselm Coll, Biol Dept, 100 St Anselm Dr,Box 1742, Manchester, NH 03102 USA.",NA

These flow-induced displacements can most easily be detected as visual whole-field motion with respect to the animal's frame of reference(2). Despite this, many aquatic animals consistently orient and swim against oncoming flows (a behaviour known as rheotaxis) even in the absence of visual cues(3,4). How animals achieve this task, and its underlying sensory basis, is still unknown. Here we show that, in the absence of visual information, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) perform rheotaxis by using flow velocity gradients as navigational cues. We present behavioural data that support a novel algorithm based on such local velocity gradients that fish use to avoid getting dragged by flowing water. Specifically, we show that fish use their mechanosensory lateral line to first sense the curl (or vorticity) of the local velocity vector field to detect the presence of flow and, second, to measure its temporal change after swim bouts to deduce flow direction. These results reveal an elegant navigational strategy based on the sensing of flow velocity gradients and provide a comprehensive behavioural algorithm, also applicable for robotic design, that generalizes to a wide range of animal behaviours in moving fluids.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,JUL 27,2017,101038nature23014,"[Oteiza, Pablo; Odstrcil, Iris; Engert, Florian] Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA./[Oteiza, Pablo; Odstrcil, Iris; Engert, Florian] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA./[Oteiza, Pablo; Portugues, Ruben] Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Sensorimotor Control Res Grp, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany./[Lauder, George] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","Oteiza, P; Engert, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Oteiza, P; Engert, F (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Oteiza, P; Portugues, R (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Neurobiol, Sensorimotor Control Res Grp, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",5873946

When a person stays stationary, the main feature that separates him/her from surroundings is the movement of chest wall due to breath. There have been many algorithms developed for breath detection while using UWB radars. However, those algorithms were almost based on a basic scheme that focused on processing in the time dimension of UWB data. They did not utilize the benefits from the wide operational bandwidth of UWB radars to show potential superiority over those narrowband systems such as a continuous wave (CW) Doppler radar. In this paper, a breath detection method was proposed based on operational bandwidth segmentation. A basic theoretical model was firstly introduced, indicating that characteristics of breath signals contained in UWB echoes were consistent among the operational frequencies, while those of clutters were not. So, the method divided a set of UWB echo data into a number of subsets, each of which corresponded to a sub-band within the operational bandwidth of the UWB radar. Thus information about the operational frequency is provided for subsequent processing. With the aid of the information, a breath enhancement algorithm was developed mainly by averaging the segmented UWB data along the operational frequency. The algorithm's performance was verified by data measured by a stepped-frequency CW (SFCW) UWB radar. The experimental results showed that the algorithm performed better than that without the segmentation. They also showed its feasibility for fast detection of breath based on a short duration of data. Moreover, the method's potential for target identification and impulse-radio (IR) UWB radar was investigated. In summary, the method provides a new processing scheme for UWB radars when they are used for breath detection. With this scheme, the UWB radars have a benefit of greater flexibility in data processing over those narrowband radars, and thus will perform more effectively and efficiently in practical applications.",MDPI,NOV,2018,103390s18113873,"[Lv, Hao; Jiao, Teng; Zhang, Yang; Liang, Fulai; Qi, Fugui; Wang, Jianqi] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Dept Med Elect, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","Wang, JQ (reprint author), Fourth Mil Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Dept Med Elect, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",NA

Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes.

We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system.

Using this method, the mating tactics of grey seal males have been classified as either 'tenured' or 'transient'. Preliminary evidence is presented of wider variation in male mating tactics and success using mobile focal-animal techniques that are not constrained by site, and of the effects of age on behaviour when accounting for body mass. The study was conducted during the breeding seasons of 1997 and 1998 at Sable Island, Nova Scotia. Six young (11-12 years) and five old (20-25 years) males were captured at the beginning of the breeding season, weighed and fitted with a VHF transmitter and time-depth recorder. Each male was located daily, and a count or late-lactating females within a 10 m radius recorded as a measure of mating potential. Female guarding and observed copulatory attempts were used as a measure of mating success. Mean initial body mass of young males and old males was similar, 291 +/- 13 kg and 298 +/- 14 kg, respectively. All males changed location during the study period. Young males changed sites more often and moved shorter distances between sites than old males. Estimated mating success varied from probably no matings to a minimum of seven; there were no differences between young and old males. Maximum duration of stay at a site and the number of late-lactating females at a site significantly influenced mating success. All the males except for two young males departed on diving excursions during the breeding season and engaged in deep diving behaviour. Diving behaviour did not differ between the age classes. Our results indicate that the current classification of mating tactics in grey seal males is an oversimplification. Preliminary data show that age may account for some of the variation in male behaviour on land and mating success, but not for behaviour at sea.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NOV,2001,101017S0952836901001418,"Smithsonian Inst, Conservat & Res Ctr, Dept Conservat Biol, Washington, DC 20008 USA./Bedford Inst Oceanog, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Marine Fish Div, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada.","Lidgard, DC (reprint author), Smithsonian Inst, Conservat & Res Ctr, Dept Conservat Biol, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",NA

These kinds of spatiotemporal data provide a new perspective for us to observe the human movement behavior. By mining such spatiotemporal data, we can incorporate the users' collective wisdom, build novel services and bring convenience to people. Through spatial clustering of the original user locations, both the 'natural' boundaries and the human activity information of the tourist attractions are generated, which facilitate performing popularity analysis of tourist attractions and extracting the travelers' spatio-temporal patterns or travel laws. On the one hand, the potential extracted knowledge could provide decision supports to the tourism management department in both tourism planning and resource development; on the other hand, the travel preferences are able to be extracted from the clustering-generated attractions, and thus, intelligent tourism recommendation services could be developed for the tourist to promote the realization of 'smart tourism'. Hence, this paper proposes a new method for discovering popular tourist attractions, which extracts hotspots through integrating spatial clustering and text mining approaches. We carry out tourist attraction discovery experiments based on the Flickr geotagged images within the urban area of Beijing from 2005 to 2016. The results show that compared with the traditional DBSCAN method, this novel approach can distinguish adjacent high-density areas when discovering popular tourist attractions and has better adaptability in the case of an uneven density distribution.

Grebes (Podicipediformes) are water birds which cannot effectively walk, thus unfledged young are assumed to be unable to depart from their natal ponds by land. We provide evidence that red-necked grebes Podiceps grisegena, breeding on ponds with scarce food resources, transferred their flightless young (2-4 weeks old) to other, unconnected ponds by land or air. Although a large proportion of breeding grebes in the study area nested on food-poor fish ponds acting as ecological traps, where they suffered significant brood losses, brood movements to new ponds accounted for only 3.3% of such breeding attempts. The infrequency of this strategy may be explained by the lack of suitable territories in close proximity and the high risk of predation or fatal injury. The means of chick transfer remains unclear; the chicks may have followed or been carried by parents shuffling across the pond levees; alternatively, parents may have carried the young on their backs in flight. Our findings indicate that red-necked grebes assess the current level of resources available for chicks and may adopt novel and risky strategies to escape total brood failure.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,JUN,2017,101007s1021101702547,"[Kloskowski, Janusz] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland./[Fraczek, Karolina] Maria Curie Skodowska Univ, Nat Conservat Dept, Inst Biol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland./[Fraczek, Karolina] Urzedowska 252, Krasnik, Poland.","Kloskowski, J (reprint author), Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Wojska Polskiego 71C, PL-60625 Poznan, Poland.",10_1007_s10211_017_0254_7

Analysis of these data revealed a rhythmic low amplitude oscillation. Further investigation of the frequency of this signal lead us to believe that the movements (<0.1 mm) are caused by the movement of blood through the nearby blood vessels. Putative heart rate decreased during dive descent and increased considerably during dive ascent reflecting the bradycardia and anticipatory tachycardia recorded by other means in other air-breathing divers. Oscillation frequencies were also comparable to the heart rate recorded in leatherbacks by means of implanted electrodes. We therefore propose that this device which was already known to reliably record behaviour such as breathing, feeding and buccal oscillations in sea turtles also has potential for recording other signals which cause movement on the external surface of an animal.

Experiments conducted in laboratory streams showed infected amphipods drifted more and compensated for drift less than non-infected individuals. When fish extract was added to the channels, non-infected individuals decreased their activity while infected individuals did not. A field study examined the up- and down-stream movements of a population of E. stammerii infected with P. laevis in the River Brenta, Italy. Drift by E. stammerii was positively influenced by acanthocephalan infection. Infected amphipods made up 40% of the drift but accounted for just 5% of the E. stammerii population. Infected individuals, however, were under-represented among upstream-moving amphipods collected from the main river channel and a near-shore migration column, comprising only 3% of sampled individuals.

Focal follow","Background: Detailed information about animal location and movement is often crucial in studies of natural behaviour and how animals respond to anthropogenic activities. Dead-reckoning can be used to infer such detailed information, but without additional positional data this method results in uncertainty that grows with time. Combining dead-reckoning with new Fastloc-GPS technology should provide good opportunities for reconstructing georeferenced fine-scale tracks, and should be particularly useful for marine animals that spend most of their time under water.
We developed a computationally efficient, Bayesian state-space modelling technique to estimate humpback whale locations through time, integrating dead-reckoning using on-animal sensors with measurements of whale locations using on-animal Fastloc-GPS and visual observations. Positional observation models were based upon error measurements made during calibrations.
Results: High-resolution 3-dimensional movement tracks were produced for 13 whales using a simple process model in which errors caused by water current movements, non-location sensor errors, and other dead-reckoning errors were accumulated into a combined error term. Positional uncertainty quantified by the track reconstruction model was much greater for tracks with visual positions and few or no GPS positions, indicating a strong benefit to using Fastloc-GPS for track reconstruction. Compared to tracks derived only from position fixes, the inclusion of dead-reckoning data greatly improved the level of detail in the reconstructed tracks of humpback whales. Using cross-validation, a clear improvement in the predictability of out-of-set Fastloc-GPS data was observed compared to more conventional track reconstruction methods. Fastloc-GPS observation errors during calibrations were found to vary by number of GPS satellites received and by orthogonal dimension analysed; visual observation errors varied most by distance to the whale.
Conclusions: By systematically accounting for the observation errors in the position fixes, our model provides a quantitative estimate of location uncertainty that can be appropriately incorporated into analyses of animal movement. This generic method has potential application for a wide range of marine animal species and data recording systems.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,NA,2015,101186s4046201500616,"[Wensveen, Paul J.; Miller, Patrick J.

fitting","A number of wildlife species including the grey partridge (Perdix perdix) have shown dramatic post-war population declines. Multiple drivers have been proposed as reasons for the declines, for example agrochemical use and intensification of agricultural practices, climate, predation, and changes in landscape structure. These drivers may interact in non-linear ways and are inherently spatio-temporal in nature. Therefore models used to investigate mechanisms should be spatio-temporal, of proper scale, and have a high degree of biological realism. Here we describe the development and testing of an agent-based model (ABM) of grey partridge using a well documented pre-decline historical data set in conjunction with a pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach. Model development was an iterative process of defining performance criteria, testing model behaviour, and reformulating as necessary to emulate system properties whilst ensuring that internal mechanisms were biologically realistic. The model was documented using ODdox, a new protocol for describing large agent-based models. Parameter fitting in the model was achieved to within +/- 2% accuracy for 15 out of 17 field data patterns used, and within 5% for the remaining two. Tests of interactions between input parameters showed that 62% of parameter pairs tested had significant interactions underlining the complex nature of the model structure. Sensitivity analysis identified chick mortality as being the most sensitive factor, followed by adult losses to hunting and adult overwinter mortality, agreeing in general with previous partridge models. However, the ABM used here could separate individual drivers, providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind population regulation, and allowing factors to be compared directly. The ABM used is rich in output signals allowing detailed testing and refinement of the model. This approach is particularly suited to systems such as the partridge system where data for comparison to model outputs is readily available. Despite the accurate fit between historical data and model output, making use of the predictive power of the approach the model requires further calibration and testing under modern field conditions.

The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.",ROYAL SOC,JUN,2018,101098rsos180438,"[Koelzsch, Andrea; Kleyheeg, Erik] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany./[Koelzsch, Andrea; Blasius, Bernd] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Grp Math Modelling, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany./[Koelzsch, Andrea; Kruckenberg, Helmut] Inst Wetlands & Waterbird Res eV IWWR, Steigbugel 3, D-27283 Verden, Aller, Germany./[Kaatz, Michael] Vogelschutzwarte Storchenhof Loburg eV, Chausseestr 18, D-39279 Loburg, Germany.","Kolzsch, A (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.; Kolzsch, A (reprint author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Grp Math Modelling, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.; Kolzsch, A (reprint author), Inst Wetlands & Waterbird Res eV IWWR, Steigbugel 3, D-27283 Verden, Aller, Germany.",NA

To test the hypothesis that foraging mode evolution is affected by habitat use, we analysed two data sets including 31 species of West Indian Anolis lizards. In this genus, the same suite of habitat specialists (or ecomorphs) has evolved on four islands, providing the replication necessary to evaluate the generality of the relationship between foraging mode and habitat use. Using habitat and behavioural data, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to determine whether species of the same ecomorph have evolved similar foraging behaviour and whether differences in foraging mode are associated with differences in habitat use. We found that Anolis species show substantial variation in foraging behaviour, including differences in movement and eating rates. Furthermore, variation among ecomorphs indicates that foraging behaviour is related to habitat use, although the specific environmental factors driving foraging divergence are unclear. Our results show that foraging mode is an evolutionarily labile trait that is influenced by evolution of habitat use. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The estimated cost of sheep and cattle production losses caused by wild dogs when combined with an extensive range of control measures, costs the Australian economy AU$66 million annually. Spatio-temporal data derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) devices were used to quantify the behavioural responses of two flocks of 15 Merino ewes ranging from 2 to 8 years old (average 4.5 years) during simulated dog predation events. Each sheep was fitted with a GNSS collar, and the behavioural responses of the sheep were video recorded during six trials (three per flock). The behavioural data collated from video recordings were then compared with the movement metrics derived from the GNSS collars. Derived metrics include the spatial distribution of flock members, speed of animal movement and specific behavioural changes including centripetal rotation (circling behaviour of the flock, with individual sheep seeking the centre). While the spatial distribution data did not appear to be specific enough to enable identification of a predation event, the velocity of sheep was higher (P < 0.001) during compared with before and after a simulated dog predation event. Centripetal rotation occurred in 80% of the simulated predation events during this study, and may provide a means for identifying predation. The spatio-temporal data from GNSS devices have potential as a research tool to assist in understanding sheep movement patterns during a dog attack.

In the fisheries community, the electronic tagging of vessels commonly designated by Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) is developing and provides a new insight for the understanding, the analysis and the modelling of the trajectories of vessels and their prospecting behaviour. VMS data are thus a clue for the proper definition of fishing effort which remains a fundamental parameter of tuna stock assessments. In this context, we used the VMS (recording of hourly positions) of the French tropical tuna purse-seiners operating in the Indian Ocean to characterise three types of movement (states) on the VMS trajectories (stillness, tracking, and cruising). Based on empirical evidences, and on the regular frequency of VMS acquisition, this was achieved by the development of a Bayesian Hidden Markov model for the speeds and turning angles derived from the hourly steps of the trajectories. In a second phase, states were related to activities disentangling stillness into fishing or stop at sea. Finally the quality of the model performances was rigorously quantified thanks to observers' data. Confronting model prediction and true activities allowed estimating that 10% of the hourly steps were misclassified. The assumptions and model' choices are discussed, highlighting the fact that VMS data and observers' data having different time resolutions, the effective use of validating data was troublesome. However, without validation, these analyses remain speculative. The validation part of this work represents an important step for the operational use of state-space models in ecology in the broad sense (predators' tracking data, e.g. birds or mammals trajectories).

Each walker is imbued with a Set Of User-specified habitat preferences that make its walking behavior resemble a particular animal species. Because the tool operates in parallel on a supercomputer, large numbers of walkers can be efficiently simulated. The importance of each habitat patch as a source or a sink for a species is calculated, consistent with existing concepts in the metapopulation literature.

The bullheads waited for shorter periods than did the caddis larvae. There was some overlap in the waiting time distributions since 32% of the caddis larvae waited for shorter times than the most persistent bullhead. The larval waiting time increased significantly with increasing attack intensity, and larvae that were exposed to simulated predator attacks (being pinched with forceps) feigned dead for less time when attacked once than when attacked three times. This indicates that larvae used information obtained during the attack for decisions about persistence time.

It eats other snails and slugs, tracking them by following their mucus trails. Although wolfsnails follow mucus trails of both prey and conspecifics, they rarely eat conspecifics, and only conspecific trails are followed directionally. We investigated how wolfsnails distinguish conspecifics from prey snails (Helix aspersa) and how they determine directionality of conspecific mucus trails. We found that wolfsnails used chemical cues present in mucus to distinguish conspecifics from prey, and were less likely to attack a snail covered with wolfsnail mucus than one covered with prey mucus (experiment 1). juvenile wolfsnails that were isolated from conspecifics before hatching recognized conspecifics as nonprey (experiment 2), and adult wolfsnails learned to follow trails of novel substances associated with exposure to other wolfsnails (experiment 3). Wolfsnails were equally attracted to both soluble and insoluble components of conspecific mucus (experiment 4) and followed conspecific mucus trails directionality even after the trails had been washed (experiment 5). We also examined whether a structural or chemical asymmetry in conspecific mucus allowed wolfsnails to determine directionality of conspecific trails. Although results of scanning electron microscopy provided no support for directionality using a structural asymmetry, manipulations of wolfsnail trails (experiments 6, 7) indicated that wolfsnails use a right/left chemical asymmetry in mucus trails to orient themselves on conspecific trails in the same direction as the trail-layer snail, independent of the trail layer's direction of movement. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,NOV,2005,101016janbehav200502017,"Delaware State Univ, Dept Biol, Sagamiko, Kanagawa 19901, Japan.","Harrington, MA (reprint author), Delaware State Univ, Dept Biol, 1200 N Dupont Highway, Sagamiko, Kanagawa 19901, Japan.",NA

surface temperature; Probability sampling; probGLS; Threshold method","Background: The use of light level loggers (geolocators) to understand movements and distributions in terrestrial and marine vertebrates, particularly during the non-breeding period, has increased dramatically in recent years. However, inferring positions from light data is not straightforward, often relies on assumptions that are difficult to test, or includes an element of subjectivity.
Results: We present an intuitive framework to compute locations from twilight events collected by geolocators from different manufacturers. The procedure uses an iterative forward step selection, weighting each possible position using a set of parameters that can be specifically selected for each analysis. The approach was tested on data from two wide-ranging seabird species-black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris and wandering albatross Diomedea exulans-tracked at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the two most contrasting periods of the year in terms of light regimes (solstice and equinox). Using additional information on travel speed, sea surface temperature and land avoidance, our approach was considerably more accurate than the traditional threshold method (errors reduced to medians of 185 km and 145 km for solstice and equinox periods, respectively).
Conclusions: The algorithm computes stable results with uncertainty estimates, including around the equinoxes, and does not require calibration of solar angles. Accuracy can be increased by assimilating information on travel speed and behaviour, as well as environmental data. This framework is available through the open source R package probGLS, and can be applied in a wide range of biologging studies.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,NOV 18,2016,101186s4046201600918,"[Merkel, Benjamin; Descamps, Sebastien; Strom, Hallvard] Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, POB 6606, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway./[Merkel, Benjamin; Yoccoz, Nigel G.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway./[Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England./[Moe, Borge] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685Sluppen, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.","Merkel, B (reprint author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, POB 6606, NO-9296 Tromso, Norway.; Merkel, B (reprint author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway.",10_1186_s40462_016_0091_8

Hanssen, Ramon F.",NA,NA,NA,"Monitoring the kinematic behavior of enormous amounts of points and objects anywhere on Earth is now feasible on a weekly basis using radar interferometry from Earth-orbiting satellites. An increasing number of satellite missions are capable of delivering data that can be used to monitor geophysical processes, mining and construction activities, public infrastructure, or even individual buildings. The parameters estimated from these data are used to better understand various natural hazards, improve public safety, or enhance asset management activities. Yet, the mathematical estimation of kinematic parameters from interferometric data is an ill-posed problem as there is no unique solution, and small changes in the data may lead to significantly different parameter estimates. This problem results in multiple possible outcomes given the same data, hampering public acceptance, particularly in critical conditions. Here, we propose a method to address this problem in a probabilistic way, which is based on multiple hypotheses testing. We demonstrate that it is possible to systematically evaluate competing kinematic models in order to find an optimal model and to assign likelihoods to the results. Using the B-method of testing, a numerically efficient implementation is achieved, which is able to evaluate hundreds of competing models per point. Our approach will not solve the nonuniqueness problem of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), but it will allow users to critically evaluate (conflicting) results, avoid overinterpretation, and thereby consolidate InSAR as a geodetic technique.",NA,JAN,2016,101109TGRS20152459037,NA,NA,NA

Because some of these turbines are large, with rapidly moving rotor blades, the risk of collision with aquatic animals has been brought to attention. The behavior and fate of animals that approach such large hydrokinetic turbines have not yet been monitored at any detail. In this paper, we conduct a synthesis of the current knowledge and understanding of hydrokinetic turbine collision risks. The outcome is a generic fault tree based probabilistic model suitable for estimating population-level ecological risks. New video-based data on fish behavior in strong currents are provided and models describing fish avoidance behaviors are presented. The findings indicate low risk for small-sized fish. However, at large turbines (>= 5 m), bigger fish seem to have high probability of collision, mostly because rotor detection and avoidance is difficult in low visibility. Risks can therefore be substantial for vulnerable populations of large-sized fish, which thrive in strong currents. The suggested collision risk model can be applied to different turbine designs and at a variety of locations as basis for case-specific risk assessments. The structure of the model facilitates successive model validation, refinement and application to other organism groups such as marine mammals.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 2,2015,101371journalpone0117756,"[Hammar, Linus; Ehnberg, Jimmy; Arvidsson, Rickard; Molander, Sverker] Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm & Energy Dept, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden./[Eggertsen, Linda; Gullstrom, Martin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden./[Andersson, Sandra] Marine Monitoring AB, Lysekil, Sweden.","Hammar, L (reprint author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm & Energy Dept, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",10_1371_journal_pone_0117756

In spite of this ecological significance, the incorporation of movement in species distribution models (SDMs) has lagged in comparison with other methodological and conceptual advancements. Many studies still ignore movement processes in applications inherently linked to movement (e.g. tracking changes in climate), and moreover, finer scale movements (e.g. foraging) have been neglected even more severely. We reviewed almost 600 research articles published in the last decade to identify important trends in the way that movement has been explicitly incorporated in SDM. We note that the conceptual differences associated with the 'object' whose movement is of interest, as well as subtler differences among taxon groups (e.g. plants v animals) and levels of organization (e.g. individuals, populations, species) that have significant implications for how movement processes occur, have hindered more substantial integration of these concepts.

The degree and scale of philopatry in a population reflect the fitness effects of social facilitation, ecological adaptation and optimal inbreeding. Patterns of breeding-site movement and fidelity are functions of social structure and are frequently sex biased. We report on a female humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) first identified by natural markings off Brazil that subsequently was photographed off Madagascar. The minimum travel distance between these locations is greater than 9800 km, approximately 4000 km longer than any previously reported movement between breeding grounds, more than twice the species' typical seasonal migratory distance and the longest documented movement by a mammal. It is unexpected to find this exceptional long-distance movement between breeding groups by a female, as models of philopatry suggest that male mammals move more frequently or over longer distances in search of mating opportunities. While such movement may be advantageous, especially in changeable or unpredictable circumstances, it is not possible to unambiguously ascribe causality to this rare observation.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a serious and prevalent chronic disease, is traditionally associated with older age. However, due to the rising rates of obesity and sedentary life-styles, it is increasingly being diagnosed in the younger population. Sedentary (sitting) behaviour has been shown to be associated with greater risk of cardio-metabolic health outcomes, including T2DM. Little is known about effective interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in younger adults at risk of T2DM. We aimed to investigate, through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, whether a group-based structured education workshop focused on sitting reduction, with self-monitoring, reduced sitting time.
Methods
Adults aged 18-40 years who were either overweight (with an additional risk factor for T2DM) or obese were recruited for the Sedentary Time ANd Diabetes (STAND) RCT. The intervention programme comprised of a 3-hour group-based structured education workshop, use of a self-monitoring tool, and follow-up motivational phone call. Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 3 and 12 months after baseline. The primary outcome measure was accelerometer-assessed sedentary behaviour after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included other objective (activPAL) and self-reported measures of sedentary behaviour and physical activity, and biochemical, anthropometric, and psycho-social variables.
Results
187 individuals (69% female; mean age 33 years; mean BMI 35 kg/m(2)) were randomised to intervention and control groups. 12 month data, when analysed using intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol analyses, showed no significant difference in the primary outcome variable, nor in the majority of the secondary outcome measures.
Conclusions
A structured education intervention designed to reduce sitting in young adults at risk of T2DM was not successful in changing behaviour at 12 months. Lack of change may be due to the brief nature of such an intervention and lack of focus on environmental change. Moreover, some participants reported a focus on physical activity rather than reductions in sitting per se. The habitual nature of sedentary behaviour means that behaviour change is challenging.",NA,DEC 1,2015,101371journalpone0143398,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0143398

However, they also move faster toward that stimulus [1-5]. This suggests that reward and effort not only affect decision-making, they also influence motor control [6, 7]. How does the brain compute the effort requirements of a task? Here, we considered data acquired during walking, reaching, flying, or isometric force production. In analyzing the decision-making and motor-control behaviors of various animals, we considered the possibility that the brain may estimate effort objectively, via the metabolic energy consumed to produce the action. We measured the energetic cost of reaching and found that, like walking, it was convex in time, with a global minimum, implying that there existed a movement speed that minimized effort. However, reward made it worthwhile to be energetically inefficient. Using a framework in which utility of an action depended on reward and energetic cost, both discounted in time, we found that it was possible to account for a body of data in which animals were free to choose how to move (reach slow or fast), as well as what to do (walk or fly, produce force F1 or F2). We suggest that some forms of decision-making and motor control may share a common utility in which the brain represents the effort associated with performing an action objectively via its metabolic energy cost and then, like reward, temporally discounts it as a function of movement duration.",CELL PRESS,JUL 25,2016,101016jcub201605065,"[Shadmehr, Reza] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Lab Computat Motor Control, 410 Traylor Bldg,720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA./[Huang, Helen J.; Ahmed, Alaa A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Neuromech Lab, 354 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA./[Huang, Helen J.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.","Ahmed, AA (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Integrat Physiol, Neuromech Lab, 354 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",NA

While such aggregates are difficult to study in the field, models of aggregation offer researchers a way to investigate how the interplay of individual behaviour makes aggregation possible and leads to different aggregate-level behaviour. This paper reviews the findings of models of aggregation, both mathematical and computer-based, with a focus on the means used to validate these models. In the context of this review it is argued that the existing de facto modelling framework, the Attraction Repulsion (AR) framework, does not allow for an adequate representation of the properties of individuals required to create validatable models of natural aggregation. However, it is further argued that the increasing use of information or perceptual fields in AR models provides a promising direction for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, because predation rates on adult turtles generally are low, it often is assumed that predators do not influence turtle behavior, affect population sizes, or structure sea turtle impacts on marine communities. Yet, sharks, killer whales and crocodiles may take adult turtles, and no sea turtle species is invulnerable. Furthermore, as long-lived animals, adult sea turtles are predicted to invest in anti-predator behavior even when predation risk is relatively low to avoid the reproductive costs of an early death. Several studies suggest that predators may influence behavior and habitat use of adult turtles. For example, in a pristine ecosystem in Australia green turtles, especially those in good body condition, avoid profitable feeding areas in order to be safe from tiger sharks. Such predation-sensitive foraging could lead to populations being partially regulated by synergistic effects of predation risk and food abundance. Indeed, observed rapid rebounds of sea turtle populations may have been facilitated by reductions in shark populations. Finally, if sea turtles modify their foraging habitat use in response to predators, the spatiotemporal pattern of turtle effects on their communities could be shaped by predators. Historical reconstructions of past turtle populations and conservation strategies aimed at increasing turtle populations must consider the possible effects of predators, including non-lethal ones. Future work should focus on gaining a broader understanding of the effects of predators across a range of sea turtle taxa and habitats. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Indian Ocean has many breeding areas for sea turtles, the southernmost ones being on the Maputaland coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where loggerhead and leatherback turtles nest in large numbers thanks to long-lasting protection programmes. For the leatherback this is the only known nesting site in the entire western Indian Ocean. At the end of the reproductive season, both loggerheads and leatherbacks undertake migrations towards disparate feeding areas. To contribute to their conservation, the migratory behaviour of these animals needs to be understood. Here we review 10 years studying this behaviour using transmitters that telemeter data via satellite. It emerges that these species frequent widely dispersed areas ranging from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mozambique Channel. The migratory behaviour of leatherback and loggerhead turtles is, however, very different, probably due to their differing food requirements.

Recently there has been renewed interest in identifying methods to reduce pain associated with dehorning and castration. Although several studies have reported that analgesic drug administration prior to castration attenuates plasma cortisol response, there are currently no compounds specifically approved for pain relief in livestock in the U.S. Validated pain assessment tools are needed to support regulatory approval of analgesic compounds. This may include use of accelerometers, videography, heart rate variability determination, electroencephalography, thermography and plasma neuropeptide measurement to assess behavioral, physiological and neuroendocrine changes associated with a pain response. Extra-label drug use (ELDU) for pain relief is regulated under the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) and requires that drugs be administered by or under the supervision of a veterinarian. Agents that may provide preemptive analgesia include local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, alpha 2-agonists, and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. A review of the published literature suggests that a significant decrease in plasma cortisol concentration after castration was associated with preemptive administration of a NSAID and local anesthesia. Local anesthesia alone tended to decrease peak plasma cortisol concentrations more than NSAIDs. However NSAIDs alone tended to decrease the area under the plasma cortisol-time curve more than local anesthesia alone. These findings suggest that multimodal analgesic regimens that extend into the post-operative period are more effective at mitigating pain and distress associated with castration than a single drug modality. Regulatory approval of safe and cost effective analgesic compounds with convenient routes of administration is needed for routine use of pain relieving drugs to be considered as standard practice at the time of castration.

Identification of individual marine mammals can be carried out using tags, brands, paint, dye, photogrammetry, telemetry and other techniques. An analysis of peer-reviewed articles published from January 1980 to April 2011 addressing the effects of marking revealed a preponderance of studies focussed on short-term effects such as injuries and behavioural changes. Some marking techniques were reported to cause pain and to change swimming and haul-out behaviour, maternal attendance, and duration of foraging trips. However, marking has typically not been found to affect survival. No published research has addressed other possible long-term effects of marking related to injuries or pain responses. Studies of the more immediate effects of marking (mostly related to externally attached devices such as radio-transmitters) have shown a variety of different types and magnitudes of responses. It is important to note that studies failing to find treament differences are less likely to be published, meaning that the present and any other reviews based on published literature may be a biased sample of all research conducted on the topic. Publishing results that found no or low impacts (i.e. best practices) as well as those that found significant impacts on animals should both be encouraged. Future research under more controlled conditions is required to document acute effects of marking, including injury and pain, and to better understand longer-term effects on health, reproduction and survival. We recommend that studies using marked animals standardise their reports, with added detail on methodology, monitoring and sampling design, and address practices used to minimise the impact of marking on marine mammals.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2012,101071WR10177,"[Walker, Kristen A.; Weary, Daniel M.] Univ British Columbia, Anim Welf Program, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada./[Trites, Andrew W.] Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Marine Mammal Res Unit, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada./[Haulena, Martin] Vancouver Aquarium, Vancouver, BC V6B 3X8, Canada.","Walker, KA (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Anim Welf Program, 2357 Main Mall,Room 180, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",NA

For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville's beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville's beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150dBrms re mu Pa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JAN 21,2014,101371journalpone0085064,"[Moretti, David; Dilley, Ashley; Neales, Bert; Shaffer, Jessica; McCarthy, Elena; Jarvis, Susan; Morrissey, Ronald] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Newport, RI 02841 USA./[Thomas, Len; Marques, Tiago; Harwood, John] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland./[New, Leslie] US Marine Mammal Commiss, Bethesda, MD USA.","Moretti, D (reprint author), Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Newport, RI 02841 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0085064

Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500x stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000x stiffness fin rays.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,JAN,2012,101242jeb062711,"[Tangorra, James L.] Drexel Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA./[Esposito, Christopher J.] Gen Dynam Corp, Elect Boat, Groton, CT 06430 USA./[Flammang, Brooke E.; Lauder, George V.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","Tangorra, JL (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",NA

The characteristically long time spans between such eruptions requires a long time series of observations to determine whether deformation without an eruption is common at a given edifice. Such studies, however, are logistically difficult to carry out in most volcanic arcs, as these tend to be remote regions with large numbers of volcanoes (hundreds to even thousands). Here we present a satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) survey of the remote central Andes volcanic arc, a region formed by subduction of the Nazca oceanic plate beneath continental South America. Spanning the years 1992 to 2000, our survey reveals the background level of activity of about 900 volcanoes, 50 of which have been classified as potentially active(2,3). We find four centres of broad (tens of kilometres wide), roughly axisymmetric surface deformation. None of these centres are at volcanoes currently classified as potentially active, although two lie within about 10 km of volcanoes with known activity.

Within the domain of wildlife ecology, a density distribution model represents one way to describe an animals' home range. Several methods have been developed to derive UDs, and subsequently home ranges. Most of these methods, e.g. kernel density estimation (KDE), and local convex hull methods, have been developed with point-based datasets in mind, and do not utilize additional information that comes with GPS-based tracking data (e.g., temporal information). To employ such additional information we extend the point-based KDE approach to work with sequential GPS-point tracks, the outcome of which is a line-based KDE. We first describe the design criteria for the line-KDE algorithm. Then we introduce the basic modeling approach and its refinement through the introduction of a scaling function. This scaling function modifies the utilization distribution so that a bone-like probability distribution for a single GPS track segment is obtained. Finally we compare the estimated utilization distributions and home ranges for two datasets derived using our line-KDE approach with those obtained using the point-KDE and Brownian Bridge (BB) approaches. Advantages of the line-based KDE by design are (i) a better representation of utilization density near GPS points when compared against the BB approach, and (ii) the ability to model and retain movement corridors when compared against point-KDE.

Trajectory data has spatio-temporal characteristics and rich information. Using trajectory data processing techniques can mine the patterns of human activities and the moving patterns of vehicles in the intelligent transportation systems. A trajectory similarity measure is one of the most important issues in trajectory data mining (clustering, classification, frequent pattern mining, etc.). Unfortunately, the main similarity measure algorithms with the trajectory data have been found to be inaccurate, highly sensitive of sampling methods, and have low robustness for the noise data. To solve the above problems, three distances and their corresponding computation methods are proposed in this paper. The point-segment distance can decrease the sensitivity of the point sampling methods. The prediction distance optimizes the temporal distance with the features of trajectory data. The segment-segment distance introduces the trajectory shape factor into the similarity measurement to improve the accuracy. The three kinds of distance are integrated with the traditional dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) algorithm to propose a new segment-based dynamic time warping algorithm (SDTW). The experimental results show that the SDTW algorithm can exhibit about 57%, 86%, and 31% better accuracy than the longest common subsequence algorithm (LCSS), and edit distance on real sequence algorithm (EDR) , and DTW, respectively, and that the sensitivity to the noise data is lower than that those algorithms.",NA,MAR,2017,103390s17030524,NA,NA,5375810

To implement this function in a robot, in this paper we introduce a self-organizing interaction and synchronization method between wearable devices and Pet-Bots. First, the Pet-Bot opportunistically identifies its owner without any human intervention, which means that the robot self-identifies the owner's approach on its own. Second, Pet-Bot's activity is synchronized with the owner's behavior. Lastly, the robot frequently encounters uncertain situations (e.g., when the robot goes ahead of the owner but meets a situation where it cannot make a decision, or the owner wants to stop the Pet-Bot synchronization mode to relax). In this case, we have adopted a gesture recognition function that uses a 3-D accelerometer in the wearable device. In order to achieve the interaction and synchronization in real-time, we use two wireless communication protocols: 125 kHz low-frequency (LF) and 2.4 GHz Bluetooth low energy (BLE). We conducted experiments using a prototype Pet-Bot and wearable devices to verify their motion recognition of and synchronization with humans in real-time.

However, attachment difficulties escalate when longer term studies requiring larger global positioning system (GPS) loggers and additional battery life are required, resulting in the use of larger, more cumbersome units. Lace Monitors (Varanus various) of Australia inhabit rugged terrain in the wild, and accurate portrayal of home range and temporal patterns of movement requires a remote data collection process. We developed a robust system of attaching GPS loggers to Lace Monitors, while allowing them to attain a full range of movement, level of activity, and foraging methods. We designed a denim pouch to house a large GPS logger with radio-transmitter, and this unit was then glued to the back of adult Lace Monitors.

Williams, Rob",NA,NA,NA,"Intense underwater sounds caused by military sonar, seismic surveys, and pile driving can harm acoustically sensitive marine mammals. Many jurisdictions require such activities to undergo marine mammal impact assessments to guide mitigation. However, the ability to assess impacts in a rigorous, quantitative way is hindered by large knowledge gaps concerning hearing ability, sensitivity, and behavioral responses to noise exposure. We describe a simulation-based framework, called SAFESIMM (Statistical Algorithms For Estimating the Sonar Influence on Marine Megafauna), that can be used to calculate the numbers of agents (animals) likely to be affected by intense underwater sounds. We illustrate the simulation framework using two species that are likely to be affected by marine renewable energy developments in UK waters: gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). We investigate three sources of uncertainty: How sound energy is perceived by agents with differing hearing abilities; how agents move in response to noise (i.e., the strength and directionality of their evasive movements); and the way in which these responses may interact with longer term constraints on agent movement. The estimate of received sound exposure level (SEL) is influenced most strongly by the weighting function used to account for the specie's presumed hearing ability. Strongly directional movement away from the sound source can cause modest reductions (similar to 5 dB) in SEL over the short term (periods of less than 10 days). Beyond 10 days, the way in which agents respond to noise exposure has little or no-effect on SEL, unless their movements are constrained by natural boundaries. Most experimental studies of noise impacts have been short-term. However, data are needed on long-term effects because uncertainty about predicted SELs accumulates over time. Synthesis and applications. Simulation frameworks offer a powerful way to explore, understand, and estimate effects of cumulative sound exposure on marine mammals and to quantify associated levels of uncertainty. However, they can often require subjective decisions that have important consequences for management recommendations, and the basis for these decisions must be clearly described.",NA,APR,2017,101002ece32699,NA,NA,10_1002_ece3_2699

The increasing availability of empirical data enables researchers to analyze patterns of people's movements. Recent work suggested that HMP follow a Levy-flight distribution and present regularity. Here, we present an innovative agent-based model that simulates HMP for various purposes. It is based on the combination of regular movements with spatial considerations, represented by an expanded gravitation model. The agents in this model have different attributes that affect their choice of destination and the duration they stay in each location. Thus, their movement mimics real-life situations. This is a stochastic, bottom-up model, yet it yields HMP that qualitatively fit HMP empirical data in terms of individuals, as well as the entire population. Our results also correspond to real-life phenomena in terms of urban spatial dynamics, that is, the emergence of popular locations in the city due to bottom-up behavior of people. Our model is novel in being based on the assumption that HMP are space-dependent as well as follow high regularity. To our knowledge, we are the first to succeed in simulating HMP not only at the inter-city scale but also at the intra-urban one.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUL 10,2015,101371journalpone0132576,"[Serok, Nimrod; Blumenfeld-Lieberthal, Efrat] Tel Aviv Univ, Yolanda & David Katz Fac Arts, David Azrieli Sch Architecture, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","Blumenfeld-Lieberthal, E (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Yolanda & David Katz Fac Arts, David Azrieli Sch Architecture, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",10_1371_journal_pone_0132576

We target a putative control muscle in the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis (L.), and simultaneously capture limb and body dynamics through high-speed videography and a micro-accelerometer backpack. We test four neuromechanical control hypotheses. We supported the hypothesis that mechanics linearly translates neural feedback into accelerations and rotations during static postural control. However, during running, the same neural feedback produced a nonlinear acceleration control potential restricted to the vertical plane. Using this, we reject the hypothesis from previous work that this muscle acts primarily to absorb energy from the body. The conversion of the control potential is paralleled by nonlinear changes in limb kinematics, supporting the hypothesis that significant mechanical feedback filters the graded neural feedback for running control. Finally, we insert the same neural feedback signal but at different phases in the dynamics. In this context, mechanical feedback enables turning by changing the timing and direction of the accelerations produced by the graded neural feedback.",ROYAL SOC,MAY 27,2011,101098rstb20100367,"[Sponberg, Simon; Spence, Andrew J.; Mullens, Chris H.; Full, Robert J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Sponberg, Simon] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./[Spence, Andrew J.] Royal Vet Coll, Struct & Mot Lab, Hatfield AL9 7TA, Herts, England./[Mullens, Chris H.] Northwestern Univ, Interdept Neurosci Program, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.","Sponberg, S (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",3130455

The environmental cues used by nocturnal migrants to select and maintain common headings, while flying in low illumination levels at great heights above the ground, and the adaptive benefits of this behaviour have long remained a mystery. Here we show how a wind-mediated mechanism accounts for the common orientation patterns of 'medium-sized' nocturnal insects. Our theory posits a mechanism by which migrants are able to align themselves with the direction of the flow using a turbulence cue, thus adding their air speed to the wind speed and significantly increasing their migration distance. Our mechanism also predicts that insects flying in the Northern Hemisphere will typically be offset to the right of the mean wind line when the atmosphere is stably stratified, with the Ekman spiral in full effect. We report on the first evidence for such offsets, and show that they have significant implications for the accurate prediction of the flight trajectories of migrating nocturnal insects.",ROYAL SOC,MAR 7,2010,101098rspb20091221,"[Reynolds, Andy M.; Reynolds, Don R.; Smith, Alan D.; Chapman, Jason W.] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England./[Reynolds, Don R.] Univ Greenwich, Nat Resources Inst, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England.","Reynolds, AM (reprint author), Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",2842736

Thus, I developed a new tag and used it to mark free-swimming whales to monitor and record their geographical and vertical movements in real time. The tag contained 2 transmitters. The sonic transmitter (50 kHz) allowed submerged whales to be tracked from less-than-or-equal-to 2 km, and it produced a pulse rate or pulse interval-coded signal from which dive depths were recorded. A VHF radio transmitter (148.00 MHz band) allowed individuals to be tracked at the sea surface from 10's of km. Initial applications of these tags on right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in the Bay of Fundy (n = 10; 1989-90) and off Massachusetts (n = 3; 1989), and on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off Massachusetts (n = 2, 1991), Socorro Island, Mexico (n = 1; 1992), and Sitka, Alaska (n = 1; 1993) provided the first direct measurements of dive profiles for mysticete whales. I made 2 configurations of the tag's housing and attachment anchor (a stainless steel dart       6.5 cm long) to serve different short- and long-term objectives. One was designed to detach after approximately 2 days by means of a corrosible, galvanic release link, then float so it could be recovered and reused. The other was designed to stay attached and transmit for up to 2 months. No adverse effects to whales from the tags or the approaches were observed. My tagging and tracking system will allow collection of precise depths and dive profiles of whales, will make it possible to coordinate and direct prey sampling efforts next to tagged whales while they are submerged, and will reduce speculation about their behavior while diving.",WILDLIFE SOC,JUL,1993,1023073809274,"UNIV GUELPH,DEPT ZOOL,GUELPH N1G 2W1,ONTARIO,CANADA.",NA,NA
"A sound approach to assessing the impact of underwater noise on marine
fishes and invertebrates",2220,"Hawkins, Anthony D.
Popper, Arthur N.",NA,NA,NA,"Increasing attention is being paid to the ecological consequences of underwater noise generated by human activities such as shipping and maritime industries including, but not limited to, oil and gas exploration and extraction, sonar systems, dredging and the construction of offshore renewable energy devices. There is particular concern over the extension of these activities into previously undeveloped areas of the oceans, including Polar Regions and areas of coral reef habitat. Most of the concern by regulators and others has focussed upon effects upon marine mammals and other protected species. However, examining the impacts upon the overall ecology of affected habitats is also important as it may be dominated by effects upon the far larger biomasses of fishes and invertebrates, which do not have the same degree of legal protection. Many of these assessments of the impact of noise on fishes and invertebrates have overlooked important issues, including the sensitivity of a substantial proportion of these species to particle motion rather than sound pressure. Attempts have been made to establish sound exposure criteria setting regulatory limits to the levels of noise in terms of effects upon mortality levels, injury to tissues, hearing abilities, behaviour, and physiology. However, such criteria have almost exclusively been developed for marine mammals. Criteria for fishes and invertebrates have often had to be assumed, or they have been derived from poorly designed and controlled studies. Moreover, the metrics employed to describe sounds from different sources have often been inappropriate, especially for fishes, and invertebrates, as they have been based on sound pressure rather than particle motion. In addition, the sound propagation models employed to assess the distances over which effects might occur have seldom been validated by actual measurements and are especially poor at dealing with transmission under shallow water conditions, close to or within the seabed, or at the surface. Finally, impacts on fish and invertebrate populations are often unknown and remain unassessed. This paper considers the problems of assessing the impact of noise upon fishes and invertebrates and the assessment procedures that need to be implemented to protect these animals and the marine ecosystems of which they form an integral part. The paper also suggests directions for future research and planning that, if implemented, will provide for a far better scientific and regulatory basis for dealing with effects of noise on aquatic life.",NA,MAR-APR,2017,101093icesjmsfsw205,NA,NA,NA

We coupled echosounder and hydrophone surveys to estimate the magnitude of the aggregation and sounds produced during spawning. We characterized individual calls and documented changes in the soundscape generated by the presence of as many as 1.5 million corvina within a spawning aggregation spanning distances up to 27 km.

However the inter-breeding distribution of such animals may reflect not only their optimal habitat, but more subtle influences on an individual's migration path, including such factors as the intrinsic influence of each locality's paleoenvironment, thereby influencing animals' wintering distribution. In this study we investigated the influence of the regional marine environment on the migration patterns of a poorly known, but important seabird group. We studied the inter-breeding migration patterns in three species of Eudyptes penguins (E. chrysolophus, E. filholi and E. moseleyi), the main marine prey consumers amongst the World's seabirds. Using ultra-miniaturized logging devices (light-based geolocators) and satellite tags, we tracked 87 migrating individuals originating from 4 sites in the southern Indian Ocean (Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen and Amsterdam Islands) and modelled their wintering habitat using the MADIFA niche modelling technique. For each site, sympatric species followed a similar compass bearing during migration with consistent species-specific latitudinal shifts. Within each species, individuals breeding on different islands showed contrasting migration patterns but similar winter habitat preferences driven by sea-surface temperatures. Our results show that inter-breeding migration patterns in sibling penguin species depend primarily on the site of origin and secondly on the species. Such site-specific migration bearings, together with similar wintering habitat used by parapatrics, support the hypothesis that migration behaviour is affected by the intrinsic characteristics of each site. The paleo-oceanographic conditions (primarily, sea-surface temperatures) when the populations first colonized each of these sites may have been an important determinant of subsequent migration patterns. Based on previous chronological schemes of taxonomic radiation and geographical expansion of the genus Eudyptes, we propose a simple scenario to depict the chronological onset of contrasting migration patterns within this penguin group.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,AUG 2,2013,101371journalpone0071429,"[Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Cherel, Yves; Pinaud, David; Bost, Charles-Andre] CNRS, Unite Propre Rech 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France./[Crawford, Robert J.

Trap-neuter-return (TNR) and trap vasectomy-hysterectomy-return (TVHR) are two humane methods for the reproductive control of feral cat populations. Both TNR and TVHR render a cat infertile, but cats that have undergone TVHR continue to produce hormones that drive mating behaviors. We built a stochastic agent-based computational model for simulating the survival, reproduction, and movement of individual feral cats and the use of TNR and TVHR to modify cats' reproductive abilities and behaviors. Daily movement of cats between colonies is implemented based on the distance between colonies and landscape properties (e.g. rural, urban). Spatially targeted TNR and TVHR policies are evaluated using two management goals: (1) reduce total population size and (2) reduce nuisance attributed to feral cats. Nuisance includes spraying and noise, both of which are associated with un-neutered males, as well as population abundance. Results indicate that both TNR and TVHR have the potential to greatly reduce population size. Effectiveness of each control depends on the capture rate, number of colonies targeted, size of each colony, and movement of individual cats between colonies. Results show that on average TVHR performs moderately better than TNR at reducing population size, but TNR substantially outperforms TVHR in reducing multiple nuisance measures.

Here, we describe and apply a spatial point process model for estimating individual centres of activity (COAs) from acoustic telemetry data that can be modified to account for both receiver- and time-specific detection probabilities. We use simulation testing to evaluate the suitability of the proposed models for estimating COAs and compare their performance to that of the popular mean-weighted COA method for a variety of scenarios. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to correct for variable detection ranges by integrating data from moored test tags and demonstrate how accounting for time-varying detection probabilities can impact space use estimates by fitting the model to data collected from a black sea bass (Centropristis striata) on a receiver array off the east coast of the United States. The proposed model reduced bias in COA estimates, particularly when tagged individuals occurred along the periphery of the receiver array. The test tag-integrated model largely corrected the bias associated with receiver- and time-specific detection probabilities. When applied to the black sea bass detection data, the model revealed fine-scale movements not apparent when detection ranges were assumed constant. Spatial management practices for coastal marine species are often based on trends in space use inferred from passive acoustic telemetry data, which can be misinterpreted when factors influencing detection ranges are not accounted for. Our approach provides a general framework for estimating individual COAs that can be modified on a study-specific basis to ensure resulting patterns of space use reflect a species' movements and behaviour, rather than variation in receiver detection ranges.",WILEY,NOV,2018,1011112041210X13080,"[Winton, Megan V.; Fay, Gavin] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Fisheries Oceanog, New Bedford, MA USA./[Kneebone, Jeff] Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Cent Wharf, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA USA./[Zemeckis, Douglas R.] Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Agr Expt Stn, Dept Agr & Nat Resources, Toms River, NJ USA.","Winton, MV (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Fisheries Oceanog, New Bedford, MA USA.",10_1111_2041_210X_13080

One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial processes. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radio-tracking data set from eastern Australia.

Camponotus pennsylvanicus",Animal movement exhibits complex behavior which can be influenced by unobserved environmental conditions. We propose a model which allows for a spatially varying movement rate and spatially varying drift through a semiparametric potential surface and a separate motility surface. These surfaces are embedded in a stochastic differential equation framework which allows for complex animal movement patterns in space. The resulting model is used to analyze the spatially varying behavior of ants to provide insight into the spatial structure of ant movement in the nest.,INST MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS,JUN,2018,10121417AOAS1113,"[Russell, James C.] Muhlenberg Coll, 2400 Chew St, Allentown, PA 18104 USA./[Hanks, Ephraim M.; Haran, Murali; Hughes, David] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.","Russell, JC (reprint author), Muhlenberg Coll, 2400 Chew St, Allentown, PA 18104 USA.",NA

bursarius; grazing systems; soil ecosystems","Spatially-explicit movement models are useful tools for elucidating how well we understand a consumer species' behavioral responses to landscape structure, as well as for exploring hypotheses concerning the factors underlying such responses. In the case of fossorial herbivores, these responses can lead to significant changes in soil properties, vegetation, and even topography. These animals search for food plants by digging tunnels through soil at plant rooting depth. I developed a spatially-explicit, stochastic movement model (SEARCH3, written in FORTRAN) to simulate the search path and associated tunnel construction undertaken by a pocket gopher (Rodentia: Geomyidae) searching for food plants. SEARCH3 assumes a landscape uniform except for number and location of plants. Input parameters include soil properties, animal size, and plant locations. Model output includes tunnel segment coordinates, positions of plants disturbed, and volume and mass of soil disturbed. Coordinates can be input into graphics software or a GIS to create line maps. The present model incorporates the three methods of segment construction presented in Andersen (1988, J. Mammal., 69: 565-582), construction parameters (e.g., tunnel size, segment length, and directionality angles) empirically described for the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), and both random and area-restricted search. SEARCH3 invokes the latter for a set period after a palatable plant is detected. The geometric attributes of paths generated by SEARCH3 conform to those of real tunnel systems at coarse scales, with the exception that looping paths from simulations featuring high plant density are uncommon among most geomyid species' systems. Results of simulations in which sensory ability and plant dispersion patterns were systematically changed support the hypothesis that area-restricted search is adaptive in this taxon. The simulation effort also suggests that research on sensory abilities and excavation mechanics would contribute greatly to understanding how these organisms both affect, and are affected by, the ecosystems in which they reside.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AUG,1996,1.01016030438009E+021,NA,"Andersen, DC (reprint author), NATL BIOTECHNOL SERV,MIDCONTINENT ECOL SCI CTR,DENVER OFF,MAILCODE D-8220,POB 25007,DENVER,CO 80225, USA.",NA

We examine, in the field and laboratory, variation in the predatory impacts of an invasive Ponto-Caspian crustacean Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907 at two sites along a spatio-temporal gradient of invasion.
Location Republic of Ireland.
Methods We used reciprocal transplant field-deployed mesocosms to compare predation rates of invasion front and well-established H. anomala on natural zooplankton assemblages. In the laboratory, we measured the functional response (relationship between predation rate and prey supply) of H. anomala from both sites, for a per capita mechanistic comparison of predation efficiency. We also assessed prey selectivity of H. anomala in the mesocosm experiments to further compare feeding behaviour. Finally, we used a correlative approach to assess the community impact of H. anomala across sites, including a nearby uninvaded site, by comparing zooplankton diversities and densities.
Results Invasion front H. anomala had higher predation rates than well-established H. anomala at high in situ zooplankton densities. Invasion front H. anomala also had higher functional responses - in particular showing higher 'attack rates' - indicating a heightened ability to locate and capture prey. Prey selectivity was consistent across the spatio-temporal contrast, with positive selection for cladocerans. Zooplankton diversity and density declined with time since H. anomala invasion, both being maximal at the uninvaded site.
Main conclusions Our study, for the first time, (1) reveals differences in predatory per capita effects and associated behavioural traits between two sites along a spatio-temporal invasion gradient and (2) shows a negative community-level impact of the invasive H. anomala in natural water bodies. Further spatio-temporal comparisons of predatory per capita effects of invaders are needed to assess the generality of these results.",WILEY,JUL,2015,101111ddi12318,"[Iacarella, Josephine C.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Grp Interuniv Res Limnol & Aquat Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada./[Iacarella, Josephine C.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, Montreal, PQ H3A OC4, Canada./[Iacarella, Josephine C.; Ricciardi, Anthony] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A OC4, Canada./[Dick, Jaimie T.

A particularly challenging example comes from studies on animals and humans where researchers use animal-attached accelerometers on moving subjects to attempt to quantify behaviour, energy expenditure and condition.
Results: The approach taken effectively concatinated three complex lines of acceleration into one visualization that highlighted patterns that were otherwise not obvious. The summation of data points within sphere facets and presentation into histograms on the sphere surface effectively dealt with data occlusion. Further frequency binning of data within facets and representation of these bins as discs on spines radiating from the sphere allowed patterns in dynamic body accelerations (DBA) associated with different postures to become obvious.
Method: We examine the extent to which novel, gravity-based spherical plots can produce revealing visualizations to incorporate the complexity of such multidimensional acceleration data using a suite of different acceleration-derived metrics with a view to highlighting patterns that are not obvious using current approaches. The basis for the visualisation involved three-dimensional plots of the smoothed acceleration values, which then occupied points on the surface of a sphere. This sphere was divided into facets and point density within each facet expressed as a histogram. Within each facet-dependent histogram, data were also grouped into frequency bins of any desirable parameters, most particularly dynamic body acceleration (DBA), which were then presented as discs on a central spine radiating from the facet. Greater radial distances from the sphere surface indicated greater DBA values while greater disc diameter indicated larger numbers of data points with that particular value.
Conclusions: We indicate how this approach links behaviour and proxies for energetics and can inform our identification and understanding of movement-related processes, highlighting subtle differences in movement and its associated energetics. This approach has ramifications that should expand to areas as disparate as disease identification, lifestyle, sports practice and wild animal ecology.

In the present study we examined the process of web-site selection and web-site tenacity by adult females of this species in a winter wheat field, Spiders were selective in their choice of web-site. Different immigration rates into various manipulated web-sites, in field and laboratory, suggested that structural support and suitable micro-climate (high humidity) are the most important factors in the selection. Small holes dug in the ground were the most favoured web-sites. Web-site occupation was influenced by the presence of other conspecific spiders. Territorial contests occurred between spiders attempting to occupy the same web, these almost invariably led to the take-over of the web when the intruder was heavier. interference, but also a certain level of tolerance, between spiders within the same web-site but in different webs was suggested by direct and indirect evidence. Many holes supported two or even three spiders in vertically stratified webs. Leaving probability of marked spiders was significantly higher in multiply occupied holes than in holes with a single web. Comparison with the results of a no-interference stochastic model showed that multiple occupancy in nature is less frequent than predicted by the model. There was further evidence for weak extra-web-interference between spiders in that multiple occupancy was even less frequent and overall occupancy was lower in web-sites which were packed close to each other. However, a level of tolerance for crowding is shown by the fact that closely packed hole colonies supported a spider density 13 times higher than in natural web-sites in the field. A marking experiment was carried out to gain information on web-site tenacity (i.e. the length of time a spider spends in a web-site) and abandonment. The average duration of tenacity was less than 2 days. A random loss function gave a good fit to the tenacity distribution and suggested that spiders abandoned web-sites randomly with a fixed leaving probability of e. 0.5. individual webs were often used consecutively by more than one spider, and some spiders built more than one web in the same web-site. Calculations showed that abandonment is the most frequent leaving mode, while take-over by contest between spiders and disappearance due to destruction were somewhat less frequent and equally likely modes of ending tenacity. It is suggested that the apparent contradiction be tween the selectiveness and competitiveness of spiders for web-sites and the relatively short tenacity observed can be resolved by hypothesising that spiders leave web-sites soon because they apply the strategy of spreading risk: spiders by frequently moving from one web-site to another distribute their reproductive efforts across several localities. This hypothesis is further supported by changes in web-sire preference and ballooning behaviour at the onset of the reproductive stage in L. tenuis.",SPRINGER VERLAG,APR,1996,101007BF00328603,"HORT RES INT,WELLESBOURNE CV35 9EF,WARWICK,ENGLAND./NATL ENVIRONM RES INST,DK-8410 RONDE,DENMARK.","Samu, F (reprint author), HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI,INST PLANT PROTECT,POB 102,H-1525 BUDAPEST,HUNGARY.",NA

This technique generates lagrangian data of a particular type in marine ecology: although highly informative about processes at different scales (e.g. horizontal movements versus diving behaviour), such data are impaired by location errors and the lack of combination with actual environmental variability. The present paper introduces a framework for modelling bluefin tuna movement in relation to its habitat, using records of light, depth and temperature from archival tags. Based on data assimilation concepts and methods, we show how an explicit formulation of the observation process and the statistics of external variables (e.g. ambient temperature) can improve precision in geolocation. The proposed method is tested on synthetic data: significant reduction (40 to 50%) in the initial root-mean square error is achieved under different noise scenarios. Assimilating sea surface temperature also allows to perform on-line estimation of a range of observation biases. The performance of the model greatly benefits from the adequate formalisation of different variability sources, and allows potentially to reveal interactions between the fish and its habitat. Using this probabilistic approach, we, however, show that some patterns of interest (e.g. foraging in surface fronts) can hardly be retrieved in a context of large observational and environmental noise.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUN,2005,101111j00301299200513777x,"Ctr Rech Halieut Mediterraneen & Trop, IFREMER, FR-34203 Sete, France./CLS, Div Oceanog Spatiale, FR-31526 Ramonville St Agne, France.","Royer, F (reprint author), Ctr Rech Halieut Mediterraneen & Trop, IFREMER, Ave Jean Monnet,BP 171, FR-34203 Sete, France.",NA

As a step toward accurate short-time tracking of changes in height (up to few minutes), we develop a stochastic model that attempts to capture some statistical properties of the barometric altimeter noise. The barometric altimeter noise is decomposed in three components with different physical origin and properties: a deterministic time-varying mean, mainly correlated with global environment changes, and a first-order Gauss-Markov (GM) random process, mainly accounting for short-term, local environment changes, the effects of which are prominent, respectively, for long-time and short-time motion tracking; an uncorrelated random process, mainly due to wideband electronic noise, including quantization noise. Autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) system identification techniques are used to capture the correlation structure of the piecewise stationary GM component, and to estimate its standard deviation, together with the standard deviation of the uncorrelated component. M-point moving average filters used alone or in combination with whitening filters learnt from ARMA model parameters are further tested in few dynamic motion experiments and discussed for their capability of short-time tracking small-amplitude, low-frequency motions.",MDPI AG,NOV,2013,103390s131115692,"[Sabatini, Angelo Maria; Genovese, Vincenzo] Scuola Super Sant Anna, BioRobot Inst, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.","Sabatini, AM (reprint author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, BioRobot Inst, Pzza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",3871085

The factors influencing these events remain poorly understood, partly because amphibian spring movements tend to radiate from breeding sites and the animals are often difficult to locate at other times of the year. In this study, we investigate whether these movement patterns can be reproduced by a parsimonious model where foraging steps follow a heavy-tailed, Levy alpha-stable distribution and individuals may either return to a previous refuge site or establish a new one. We consider three versions of the return behaviour: (1) a distance-independent probability of return to any previous refuge; (2) constant probability of return to the nearest refuge; or (3) a distance-dependent probability of return to each refuge. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we fit each version of the model to radiotracking data from a population of Fowler's Toads, which inhabits a linear sand dune habitat on the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. Only the model with distance-independent, random returns provides a good fit of the inter-refuge distance distribution and the number of refuges visited per toad. Our results suggest that while toads occasionally forage over long distances, the establishment of new refuges is not driven by the minimization of energy expenditure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the value of data collected by animal-borne telemetry systems is limited by bandwidth constraints. To understand the response of Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) to rapid changes in sea ice availability, we required continuous geospatial chronologies of foraging behavior. Satellite telemetry offered the only practical means to systematically collect such data; however, data transmission constraints of satellite data-collection systems limited the data volume that could be acquired. Although algorithms exist for reducing sensor data volumes for efficient transmission, none could meet our requirements. Consequently, we developed an algorithm for classifying hourly foraging behavior status aboard a tag with limited processing power. We found a 98% correspondence of our algorithm's classification with a test classification based on time-depth data recovered and characterized through multivariate analysis in a separate study. We then applied our algorithm within a telemetry system that relied on remotely deployed satellite tags. Data collected by these tags from Pacific walruses across their range during 2007-2015 demonstrated the consistency of foraging behavior collected by this strategy with data collected by data logging tags; and demonstrated the ability to collect geospatial behavioral chronologies with minimal missing data where recovery of data logging tags is precluded. Our strategy for developing a telemetry system may be applicable to any study requiring intelligent algorithms to continuously monitor behavior, and then compress those data into meaningful information that can be efficiently transmitted.

Placing this process in an environmental context requires a lot of information regarding the characteristics of both the habitat selected by the animal and its surroundings. In high-latitude marine systems, information about subsurface habitats of marine predators is often very limited. Animal-borne oceanographic instruments have added a new modality to improve our understanding of marine predators and their habitats. While these instruments do not collect environmental information beyond that experienced by the animals carrying them, our study makes use of an oceanographic dataset collected by southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; N = 15), to provide environmental context for two sympatrically foraging penguin species in the waters close to the subantarctic island of Bouvetoya. The seals collected 154 CTD profiles during the study period, averaging 4.9 (+/- 3.67) profiles per day, documenting the stratification of the upper water layer in terms of both seawater density and temperature. Using these data, we quantitatively describe the relationship between the diving behavior of the penguins (N = 3,745 dives) and the hydrographic properties of the three-dimensional area in which they were foraging. Both penguin species appeared to favor water characterized by a shallow mixed layer. The chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) dove within a shallow, unstable body of water close to the colony, whereas macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) exploited the bottom of the surface mixed layer further offshore. The hydrographic properties preferred by the penguins match closely those that describe the highest densities of their preferred prey, krill (Euphausia superba), identified during a temporally and spatially concurrent study. We demonstrate how merging multiple telemetric data streams from animals can shed new light on aspects of foraging behavior beyond simply relating movements to two-dimensional, remotely sensed measurements of the environment.",NA,DEC,2015,101890ES15002931,NA,NA,NA

Whilst in the GAB, they are the focus of a commercially important Australian fishery. Recent expansion of activities associated with oil and gas exploration in the GAB over the last five years has raised concerns that noise associated with geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling activities may impact on the migration and behaviour of SBT, with potential flow-on effects on the commercial fishery and current monitoring of the population for management purposes.
As a first step in identifying the potential impacts of expansion of oil and gas exploration activities in the GAB on SBT, we establish the historical extent of these activities in the GAB with a primary focus on geophysical surveys. Potential overlap with the distribution of juvenile SBT in the GAB determined from an archival tag dataset (1998-2011) was then explored. Geophysical surveys have occurred throughout the vast majority of the region since 1960, with the size of energy sources used in surveys and the extent of areas surveyed increasing through time. The use of more complex, higher density 3D surveys has increased gradually since 2000. The timing and distribution of exploration activity has had varying degrees of overlap with SBT occurrence and distribution as described by tagged fish.
Determining robust measures of the responses to surveys however, is difficult due to a paucity of data on the hearing capabilities of SBT, uncertainties in the true extent of spatial overlap of activities and tagged fish resulting from geolocation methods used for position estimation from archival tag data, complexities in the drivers of behaviour in SBT, and limitations with using observational data to determine cause-and-effect relationships. These difficulties are typical not just of SBT and the GAB region, but apply to investigations of the responses of marine animals to geophysical surveys more broadly. The data presented in this study, however, represent a first step towards understanding oil and gas exploration within a defined region of the Australian marine environment, and provide important context for exploring the potential impact of such activities on a commercially important top order predator of the GAB ecosystem.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,NOV-DEC,2018,101016jdsr2201805024,"[Evans, Karen; Eveson, Paige; Patterson, Toby] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia./[McCauley, Robert D.] Curtin Univ, Ctr Marine Studies & Technol, Kent St, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia.","Evans, K (reprint author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",NA

We conducted a literature survey and canvassed the ecological community to identify experimental studies of terrestrial habitat fragmentation and to determine whether consistent themes were emerging from these studies. Our survey revealed 20 fragmentation experiments worldwide. Most studies focused on effects of fragmentation on species richness or on the abundance(s) of particular species. Other important themes were the effect of fragmentation in interspecific interactions, the role of corridors and landscape connectivity in individual movements and species richness, and the influences of edge effects on ecosystem services. Our comparisons showed a remarkable lack of consistency in results across studies, especially with regard to species richness and abundance relative to fragment size. Experiments with arthropods showed the best fit with theoretical expectations of greater species richness on larger fragments. Highly mobile taxa such as birds and mammals, early-successional plant species, long-lived species, and generalist predators did not respond in the ""expected"" manner. Reasons for these discrepancies included edge effects, competitive release in the habitat fragments, and the spatial scale of the experiments. One of the more consistently supported hypotheses was that movement and species richness are positively affected by corridors and connectivity, respectively. Transient effects dominated many systems; for example, crowding of individuals on fragments commonly was observed after fragmentation, followed by a relaxation toward lower abundance in subsequent years. The three long-term studies (greater than or equal to 14 years) revealed strong patterns that would have been missed in short-term investigations. Our results emphasize the wide range of species-specific responses to fragmentation, the need for elucidation of behavioral mechanisms affecting these responses, and the potential for changing responses to fragmentation over time.",WILEY,APR,2000,101046j15231739200098081x,"Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, Ames, IA 50011 USA./Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ctr Biodivers Res, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA./Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.","Debinski, DM (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anim Ecol, 124 Sci 2, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",NA

While taking design issues, such as small size hardware as well as low power computing, into account, a lot of research has been proposed to accomplish the given tasks in WBAN. However, since most of the existing works are basically developed by assuming all nodes in the static state, these schemes therefore cannot be applied in real scenarios where network topology between sensor nodes changes frequently and unexpectedly according to human moving behavior. However, as far as the authors know, there is no survey paper to focus on research challenges for mobility support in WBAN yet. To address this deficiency, in this paper, we present the state-of-the-art approaches and discuss the important features of related to mobility in WBAN. We give an overview of mobility model and categorize the models as individual and group. Furthermore, an overview of networking techniques in the recent literature and summary are compiled for comparison in several aspects.

For 59 groups tracked by theodolite, the average distance offshore peaked at 2 to 2.5 km. Independent information on offshore distribution was obtained from 1112 km searched by a ski-boat in the vicinity of Cape Columbine, from which the proportions of humpback whale groups in 2 strata (0 to 5 and > 5 km) from the shore as seen from the lighthouse did not differ from those expected from the boat data. Net directions of movement for 51 groups were distributed equally to all 4 quadrants of the compass, and those groups showing a concerted directionality of movement were headed equally to the north and to the south. Of the same 51 groups, 70% travelled at net speeds of less than 1.5 km h(-1). Migratory indices for individual groups (average speed/net speed) ranged as high as 82, and those with the lowest indices (corresponding to those most likely to be migrating) were distributed equally between northerly and southerly directions. Individual identification photographs taken of 27 humpback whales over 20 d revealed only 10 individuals, 5 of which were resighted on more than 1 occasion and up to 20 d apart. Apparent feeding behaviour by humpback whales was seen on 10 occasions over 38 d, and the production of reddish particulate faeces indicative of recent feeding was seen on 7 occasions, at a defecation rate of 0.22 whale(-1) h(-1). Faecal samples collected contained euphausiid remains (possibly Euphausia lucens) on 2 occasions and amphipods on another.

The current North American paradigm for regulating activities that may result in behavioural responses identifies received levels (RL) of sound at which individuals are predicted to display significant behavioural responses (often termed harassment). The recurrent conclusion about the need for considering context of exposure, in addition to RL, when assessing probability and severity of behavioural responses led us to conduct a systematic literature review (370 papers) and analysis (79 studies, 195 data cases). The review summarized the critical and complex role of context of exposure. The analysis emphasized that behavioural responses in cetaceans (measured via a linear severity scale) were best explained by the interaction between sound source type (continuous, sonar, or seismic/explosion) and functional hearing group (a proxy for hearing capabilities). Importantly, more severe behavioural responses were not consistently associated with higher RL and vice versa. This indicates that monitoring and regulation of acoustic effects from activities on cetacean behaviour should not exclusively rely upon generic multispecies RL thresholds. We recommend replacing the behavioural response severity score with a response/no response dichotomous approach that can represent a measure of impact in terms of habitat loss and degradation.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",DEC,2016,101139cjz20160098,"[Gomez, C.; Lawson, J.

In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works.

We aimed to create a temporally explicit species distribution model describing the full annual distribution cycle, and use it to model the complex seasonal shifts in distribution of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus, a declining long-distance migrant. To do this we used full-year satellite telemetry occurrence data, with their associated temporal information, to inform a temporally explicit species distribution model using MaxEnt. The resulting full-year distribution model was highly predictive (AUC = 0.894) and appeared to have generality at the species-level despite being informed by data from a single breeding population. Comparison of our methodology with seasonal distribution models describing the breeding, winter and migration ranges separately showed that our full-year method provided more general and extensive predictions and performed better when tested with an independent dataset. When species distribution models based on a single season exclude environmental conditions experienced by birds in other parts of the annual cycle they risk underestimating niche breadth and neglecting the importance of stopover habitat. Conversely, models which simply average conditions across a season may miss the significance of finer scale within-season movements and overestimate niche breadth. In contrast, our framework for a full-year migrant distribution model successfully captures the finer-scale changes expected in seasonal environments and can be used to inform conservation management at every stage of migration. The full-year model framework appears to produce temporal distribution models generalised to the species-level from occurrence data limited to few individuals of a single population and may have particular utility when aiming to describe the distribution of species with complex migration patterns from telemetry data.",WILEY,DEC,2017,101111jav01476,"[Williams, Heather M.; Willemoes, Mikkel; Thorup, Kasper] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark./[Williams, Heather M.] SUNY Buffalo, Grad Program Evolut Ecol & Behav, Cooke Hall, Buffalo, NY USA.","Williams, HM (reprint author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark.",NA

With the advent of automated data collection through GPS and other location sensing systems, researchers have the opportunity to examine human mobility at spatio-temporal resolution heretofore impossible. However, the copious and complex data collected through these logging systems can be difficult for humans to fully exploit, leading many researchers to propose novel metrics for encapsulating movement patterns in succinct and useful ways. A particularly salient proposed metric is the mobility entropy rate of the string representing the sequence of locations visited by an individual. However, mobility entropy rate is not scale invariant: entropy rate calculations based on measurements of the same trajectory at varying spatial or temporal granularity do not yield the same value, limiting the utility of mobility entropy rate as a metric by confounding inter-experimental comparisons. In this paper, we derive a scaling relationship for mobility entropy rate of non-repeating straight line paths from the definition of Lempel-Ziv compression. We show that the resulting formulation predicts the scaling behavior of simulated mobility traces, and provides an upper bound on mobility entropy rate under certain assumptions. We further show that this formulation has a maximum value for a particular sampling rate, implying that optimal sampling rates for particular movement patterns exist.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,AUG 29,2016,101371journalpone0161630,"[Osgood, Nathaniel D.; Paul, Tuhin; Stanley, Kevin G.; Qian, Weicheng] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada./[Osgood, Nathaniel D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.","Paul, T (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",10_1371_journal_pone_0161630

radar velocity measurement; sea surface; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","The concept of the ""velocity synthetic aperture radar"" (VSAR)-a multiaperture sensor capable of measuring radial velocities in the scene and utilizing this information to correct motion-induced imaging distortions inherent to SAR-was proposed two decades ago. Lately, with the emergence of truly multichannel systems featuring antenna arrays with dozens of elements, the approach has been enjoying a renewed interest. The viability and effectiveness of the algorithm were successfully demonstrated in a series of airborne field campaigns that involved imaging both man-made targets and natural maritime features. These experiments and the wealth of resulting data also underscored the need for comprehensive mathematical descriptions of expected target signatures in the collected ""image stacks"" and for further refinements of the VSAR imaging theory. This paper addresses both tasks by building upon the available mathematical results developed for the along-track interferometric SAR imagery of distributed evolving targets. The approach allows simultaneous accounting for all essential effects known to impact SAR imagery of a target or an extended feature: its azimuth velocity, radial velocity and acceleration, as well as finite coherence time. The emphasis is on obtaining closed-form expressions that could readily illustrate the structure and behavior of the VSAR stack spectrum of such a target and help gauge anticipated focusing improvement stemming from the VSAR image correction. In particular, it is rigorously shown that the VSAR algorithm is successful in situations when SAR defocusing arises predominantly from radial motion and short coherence times-the resulting resolution is generally no worse than that of the corresponding real-aperture radar. On the other hand, strong defocusing due to azimuth translation may be problematic to compensate within the VSAR approach framework.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,SEP,2017,101109TGRS20172697843,"[Toporkov, Jakov V.] US Naval Res Lab, Remote Sensing Div, Washington, DC 20375 USA.","Toporkov, JV (reprint author), US Naval Res Lab, Remote Sensing Div, Washington, DC 20375 USA.",NA

Particularly, early telemetry studies were conducted on vultures and condors due to three main reasons: i) these birds capture the curiosity of humans, ii) their large body size allows researchers to deploy large telemetry units, and iii) they are of high conservation concern. This has resulted in a great number of scientific articles that remain scattered throughout the literature. To achieve a more cohesive view of vultures and condors movement behavior, we review all telemetry studies published up to 2017. We first present a descriptive summary of the technical and design characteristics of these studies (e.g. target species, tagging location, number of individuals tagged) and go on to discuss them under a common conceptual framework; the Movement Ecology Paradigm. The articles found (N = 97) were mainly published in the last decade and based on the tagging of individuals from 14 species (61% of the extant species) and 24 countries. Foraging was the most in-depth investigated movement phase (25 studies), with studies covering several species, using both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches and tackling the role of different drivers of movement. In contrast, commuting and natal dispersal phases were only superficially investigated (3 and 8 studies, respectively). Finally, studies dealing with the conservation and management also comprised a large portion of the reviewed articles (24 studies). Telemetry studies have revealed relevant details of vultures and condors movements, with highly accurate measurements of flight energetics and a better understanding of the morphological, physiological and context-dependent drivers that underlie the movement decisions of these birds. However, we also detected several information gaps.

Yet fisheries and seabirds may also compete for the same resources, and their interactions can lead to additional seabird mortality through accidental bycatch and diminishing fishing efficiency, threatening vulnerable seabird populations. Understanding these complex relationships is essential for conservation strategies, also because it could enhance and ease discussion between stakeholders, towards a common vision for marine ecosystem management. As an aid in this process, we reviewed 510 scientific publications dedicated to seabirds-fisheries interactions, and compiled a methodological toolkit. Methods employed therein serve four main purposes: (i) Implementing distribution overlap analyses, to highlight areas of encounter between seabirds and fisheries (ii) Analysing movement and behavioural patterns using finer-scale information, to characterize interaction types (iii) Investigating individual-scale feeding ecology, to assess fisheries impacts at the scale of bird populations, and (iv) Quantifying the impacts of seabird-fishery interactions on seabird demography and population trends. This latter step allows determining thresholds and tipping points with respect to ecological sustainability.

A new technique is shown to be promising because it call combine acoustic sizing with fish behavior studies. The principle of radar tracking, aligning the: antenna beam with a target, was applied with an acoustic splitbeam transducer and dual axis rotators for tracking individual fish over long periods of time. Deviation of the target from the beam axis produces a correction to point the axis toward the target. Initial studies with active acoustics have also evolved an acoustic tag tracking method. The system has successfully tracked several different types of fish, from juvenile salmon to sharks. The high speed of the rotators allows observations to be made at very short ranges. Much of the development of the tracking transducer targeted fish movement through darns on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. In a recent experiment, adult salmon, returning to the Fraser River, Canada were tracked to measure avoidance to surveying vessels. The feasibility for tracking sharks was shown at the Tacoma WA Point Defiance Aquarium. A proposed method for tracking salmon, sharks or other species with echoes and/or using acoustic tags will allow the determination of behavior, acoustic size, abundance, and associated pelagic assemblages.

The intermediate host, the rough periwinkle, Littorina saxatilis, is present Lear-round on rocky shores and has a high parasite prevalence near breeding colonies of the definitive host, the herring gull, Larus argentatus, which is present in numbers at these sites for only 4 months per year. Given the seasonal availability of gulls for infection and a low incidence of periwinkles in the normal diet of herring gulls, specialized transmission between stages appears necessary for maintenance of the parasite's life cycle. We investigated the hypothesis that M. piriformes alters its intermediate host's behaviour during the gull's breeding season in a manner that may facilitate predation of the infected periwinkle by breeding gulls, We studied the movements of periwinkles during simulated tidal cycles in the laboratory; parasite status was established subsequently. Periwinkles with mature infections moved further upwards but showed less downwards and horizontal movement than uninfected periwinkles. The movement of periwinkles with immature (nontransmissible) infections was less affected by the parasite. During the tidal cycle, infected and uninfected periwinkles differed in both timing and extent of movement. A field experiment confirmed the greater upwards movement of infected periwinkles. The parasite-induced changes in periwinkle behaviour may increase the chances of predation by the final host and could represent an important survival strategy for M. piriformes.

However, because of the influence of GPS signal loss, data drift and repeated access in the individual trajectory data, the efficiency and accuracy of existing algorithms have some deficiencies. Therefore, we propose a two-step clustering approach to extract individuals' locations according to their GPS trajectory data. Firstly, we defined three different types of stop points; secondly, we extracted these points from the trajectory data by using the spatio-temporal clustering algorithm based on time and distance. The experimental results show that the spatio-temporal clustering algorithm outperformed traditional extraction algorithms. It can avoid the problems caused by repeated access and can substantially reduce the effects of GPS signal loss and data drift. Finally, an improved clustering algorithm based on a fast search and identification of density peaks was applied to discover the trajectory locations.

In order to get a better study and application of the vertical crustal movement, as well as its changes, the foundation and prerequisite areto devise and establish its reference frame; especially, a unified global reference frame is required. Since SLR (satellite laser ranging) is one of the most accurate space techniques for monitoring geocentric motion and can directly measure the ground station's geocentric coordinates and velocities relative to the centre of the Earth's mass, we proposed to take the vertical velocity of the SLR technique in the ITRF2008 framework as the reference frame of vertical crustal motion, which we defined as the SLR vertical reference frame (SVRF). The systematic bias between other velocity fields and the SVRF was resolved by using the GPS (Global Positioning System) and VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) velocity observations, and the unity of other velocity fields and SVRF was realized, as well. The results show that it is feasible and suitable to take the SVRF as a reference frame, which has both geophysical meanings and geodetic observations, so we recommend taking the SLR vertical velocity under ITRF2008 as the global reference frame of vertical crustal movement.",NA,FEB,2016,103390s16020225,NA,NA,4801601

Despite both types of interaction fundamentally influencing animal behaviour, there has hitherto been no unifying framework for the models proposed in both areas. Here, we construct a general method for inferring population-level spatial patterns from underlying individual movement and interaction processes, a key ingredient in building a statistical mechanics for ecological systems. We show that resource selection functions, as well as several examples of collective motion models, arise as special cases of our framework, thus bringing together resource selection analysis and collective animal behaviour into a single theory. In particular, we focus on combining the various mechanistic models of territorial interactions in the literature with step selection functions, by incorporating interactions into the step selection framework and demonstrating how to derive territorial patterns from the resulting models.

"A unifying framework for the underlying mechanisms of avian avoidance of
wind turbines",3981,"May, Roel F.",NA,NA,NA,"The construction and operation of wind-power plants may affect birds through collision mortality, reduced habitat utilization due to disturbance, barriers to movement and habitat modifications, with the nature and magnitude of those effects being site- and species-specific. Birds may however manage these effects through fleeing, activity shifts or changed habitat utilization; usually termed avoidance. Given the important role avoidance plays in estimating the impact wind-power development has on birds, there is a pressing need to formalizing the avoidance process. Crucial in this context is to identify the underlying mechanisms of behavioural responses by birds to wind-power plants and individual turbines. To provide a better basis for and improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms for avoidance a conceptual framework for wind-turbine avoidance is presented decomposing various forms of avoidance at different spatial scales. Avoidance behaviour includes displacement (macro-avoidance), anticipatory and impulsive evasion (meso-avoidance), and escape (micro-avoidance). For understanding why particular responses occur with regard to wind-turbine disturbance this concept is applied to predation risk theory. The risk-disturbance hypothesis elucidates possible trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and fitness-enhancing activities. The four behavioural responses are related to, respectively, habitat selection, vigilance and fleeing (twice); from which specific predictions can be derived. Formalizing the different forms of avoidance facilitates design of effects studies, enhances comparisons among sites studied, and guide siting and mitigation strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Adoption by females may be adaptive by increasing inclusive fitness via shared genes between adoptive mother and adoptee or by providing valuable maternal practice which, in turn, may increase the female's future reproductive success. Others have argued that adoption may be non-adaptive and the result of a general attraction toward infants. Our study examines a unique case of adoption by an adult female Angola black and white colobus monkey (Colobus angolensis palliatus) who adopted an extra-group infant alongside her own biological infant. We compare infant behaviors and mother-infant interactions between biological infant and adoptee and then compare both biological infant and adoptee behavioral profiles to those of infants under normal circumstances. Data were collected from July 2014 to June 2015 on three habituated groups in the Diani Forest of Kenya. Scan sampling and pooled data were used to create daily and monthly behavioral profiles for the biological infant and adoptee, as well as a mean monthly profile of four infants under normal circumstances. Data include time spent (1) clinging to mother/adoptive mother, (2) clinging to another individual, (3) behaving independently, and (4) behaving in close proximity to mother/adoptive mother. Initially, the adoptee struggled to achieve behavioral profiles consistent with those of the biological infant and normal colobus infants of the same age as he spent significantly more time moving independently and significantly less time clinging to the adoptive mother. After the mysterious death of the biological infant in mid-January 2015, the adoptee assumed a behavioral profile similar to that of infants under normal conditions. This case does not support adaptive hypotheses for adoption (i.e., inclusive fitness or learning to mother). Instead, because the biological infant died, possibly due to the presence of the adoptee, we argue that this case of infant adoption was non-adaptive. Ultimately, this adoption appears to have been an outcome of the adoptee's persistent desire to be cared for and the female's strong propensity to engage in allomaternal behavior.",SPRINGER JAPAN KK,APR,2016,101007s1032901605155,"[Dunham, Noah Thomas] Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA./[Opere, Paul Otieno] Univ Eastern Africa, Dept Conservat Biol, Baraton, Kenya.","Dunham, NT (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",10_1007_s10329_016_0515_5

The use of forceplates and foot-mounted accelerometers readily allows the detection of the foot-on and foot-off events that define a stride. However, when relying on optical methods such as motion capture, there is lack of validated robust, universally applicable stride event detection methods. To date, no method has been validated for movement on a circle, while algorithms are commonly specific to front/hind limbs or gait. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate kinematic stride segmentation methods applicable to movement on straight line and circle at walk and trot, which exclusively rely on a single, dorsal hoof marker. The advantage of such marker placement is the robustness to marker loss and occlusion. Eight horses walked and trotted on a straight line and in a circle over an array of multiple forceplates. Kinetic events were detected based on the vertical force profile and used as the reference values. Kinematic events were detected based on displacement, velocity or acceleration signals of the dorsal hoof marker depending on the algorithm using (i) defined thresholds associated with derived movement signals and (ii) specific events in the derived movement signals. Method comparison was performed by calculating limits of agreement, accuracy, between-horse precision and within-horse precision based on differences between kinetic and kinematic event. In addition, we examined the effect of force thresholds ranging from 50 to 150 N on the timings of kinetic events. The two approaches resulted in very good and comparable performance: of the 3,074 processed footfall events, 95% of individual foot on and foot off events differed by no more than 26 ms from the kinetic event, with average accuracy between -11 and 10 ms and average within-and between horse precision <= 8 ms. While the event-based method may be less likely to suffer from scaling effects, on soft ground the threshold-based method may prove more valuable. While we found that use of velocity thresholds for foot on detection results in biased event estimates for the foot on the inside of the circle at trot, adjusting thresholds for this condition negated the effect. For the final four algorithms, we found no noteworthy bias between conditions or between front-and hind-foot timings. Different force thresholds in the range of 50 to 150 N had the greatest systematic effect on foot-off estimates in the hind limbs (up to on average 16 ms per condition), being greater than the effect on foot-on estimates or foot-off estimates in the forelimbs (up to on average +/- 7 ms per condition).",PEERJ INC,MAR 26,2015,107717peerj783,"[Starke, Sandra D.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England./[Clayton, Hilary M.] Sport Horse Sci LC, Mason, MI USA.","Starke, SD (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Elect Elect & Syst Engn, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",10_7717_peerj_783

2. We have developed a minimally invasive telemetry system for ruminants that is capable of measuring heart rate (HR), body temperature (T-b) and locomotor activity (LA). A ruminal transmitter unit was per os placed into the reticulum and therefore located in close proximity to the heart. The unit detected HR by the use of an acceleration sensor and also measured T-b. HR and T-b signals were transmitted via short-distance UHF link to a repeater system located in a collar unit. The collar unit decoded and processed signals received from the ruminal unit, measured LA with two different activity sensors and transmitted pulse interval-modulated VHF signals over distances of up to 10 km.
3. HR data measured with the new device contained noise caused by reticulum contractions and animal movements that triggered the acceleration sensor in the ruminal unit. We have developed a software filter to remove this noise. Hence, the system was only capable of measuring HR in animals that showed little or no activity and in the absence of rumen contractions. Reliability of this 'stationary HR' measurement was confirmed with a second independent measurement of HR detected by an electrocardiogram in a domestic sheep (Ovis aries).
4. In addition, we developed an algorithm to correctly classify an animal as 'active' or 'at rest' during each 3-min interval from the output of the activity sensors. Comparison with direct behavioural observations on free-ranging Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) showed that 87% of intervals were classified correctly.
5. First results from applications of this new technique in free-ranging Alpine ibex underlined its suitability for reliable and long-term monitoring of physiological and behavioural parameters in ruminants under harsh field conditions. With the battery settings and measurement cycles used in this study, we achieved a system lifetime of approximately 2 years.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,MAR,2010,101111j2041210X200900010x,"[Signer, Claudio; Ruf, Thomas; Schober, Franz; Fluch, Gerhard; Paumann, Thomas; Arnold, Walter] Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.","Signer, C (reprint author), Univ Vet Med, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.",NA

We quantified the terrestrial movements of O. maculosus and compared them to (1) their aquatic locomotion, (2) terrestrial locomotion of closely-related subtidal species (Leptocottus armatus and Icelinus borealis), and (3) terrestrial movements of walking catfishes (Clarias spp.). We recorded sculpin movements (210 fps) on a terrestrial platform and in a water tank and tracked body landmarks for kinematic analysis. The axial-appendage-based terrestrial locomotion of O. maculosus is driven by cyclic lateral oscillations of the tail, synchronized with alternating rotations about the base of the pectoral fins, a behavior that appears similar to a military ""army crawl."" The pectoral fins do not provide propulsion, but act as stable points for the body to rotate around. In contrast, individuals of O. maculosus use primarily axial undulation during slow-speed swimming. The army crawl is a more effective terrestrial behavior (greater distance ratio) than the movements produced by L. armatus and I. borealis, which use rapid, cyclic oscillations of the tail, without coordinated pectoral fin movements. Relative to Clarias spp., O. maculosus rotated the body about the base of the pectoral fin, rather than the tip of the fin, which may cause O. maculosus to have a lower distance ratio. Since O. maculosus lack major morphological adaptations for terrestrial locomotion, instead relying on behavioral adaptations, we propose behavioral adaptations may evolutionarily predate morphological adaptations for terrestrial locomotion in vertebrates.",ELSEVIER GMBH,DEC,2018,101016jzool201810003,"[Bressman, Noah R.] Cornell Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, 232 East Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA./[Bressman, Noah R.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Hall,1834 Wake Forest Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA./[Bressman, Noah R.; Gibb, Alice C.; Farina, Stacy C.] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA./[Gibb, Alice C.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol, 617 South Beaver St, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA./[Farina, Stacy C.] Howard Univ, Dept Biol, 415 Coll St NW, Washington, DC 20059 USA.","Bressman, NR (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Hall,1834 Wake Forest Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",NA

The result is an avalanche of complex tri-axial accelerometer data streams that capture observations and measurements of a wide range of animal body motion and posture parameters. Analysis of these parameters enables the identification of specific animal behaviors however the analysis process is immature with much of the activity identification steps undertaken manually and subjectively. Consequently, there is an urgent, need for the development of new tools to streamline the management, analysis, indexing, querying and visualization of such data. In this paper, we present a Semantic Annotation and Activity Recognition (SAAR) system which supports storing, visualizing, annotating and automatic recognition of tri-axial accelerometer data streams by integrating semantic annotation and visualization services with Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The interactive Web interface enables biologists to visualize and correlate 3D accelerometer data streams with associated video streams. It also enables domain experts to accurately annotate or tag segments of tri-axial accelerometer data streams, with standardized terms from an activity ontology. These annotated data streams can then be used to dynamically train a hierarchical SVM activity classification model, which can be applied to new accelerometer data streams to automatically recognize specific activities. This paper describes the design, implementation and functional details of the SAAR system and the results of the evaluation experiments that assess the performance, usability and efficiency of the system. The evaluation results indicate that the SAAR system enables ecologists with little knowledge of machine learning techniques to collaboratively build classification models with high levels of accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity.

"A wildlife movement approach to optimally locate wildlife crossing
structures",3576,"Loraamm, Rebecca W.
Downs, Joni A.",NA,NA,NA,"Transportation networks negatively impact wildlife populations by limiting the physical movement of the individual animal. In extreme cases road presence can lead to collisions between vehicles and animals, resulting in direct mortality if an animal attempts to cross the road. Crossing structures are one commonly used method for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions. However, limited funding often reduces the amount of structures that may be constructed in practice. Therefore, areas that have the highest probability for animal interactions with roads should be targeted for locating new structures to provide the best possible outcome. This research uses a probabilistic time-geographic strategy coupled with a site selection phase handled by a classical optimization model to site wildlife crossing structures. To achieve optimal site selection, crossing locations are first identified where wildlife frequently cross roads, and then a maximum covering location problem is applied to these areas as demand nodes. The objective is to cover the largest area having the highest probability of interaction given a finite number of crossing structures available to be located. Coverage is defined in terms of fencing distance associated with a particular structure. The approach was demonstrated using Florida panther telemetry data identifying potential crossing structures across two counties in south Florida. The maximal covering location problem (MCLP) was solved for four coverage distances using radio telemetry tracking data, which captured frequent contact with roads. The results identify that the most effective coverage distance is 2000m, which incrementally covers more total animal-road interaction probability than that of lower fencing distances in the case of the Florida panther. The results illustrate how this new time-geographic approach, combined with location modeling, measures animal-road interactions probabilistically for finding the optimum placement of wildlife crossing structures.",NA,JAN 2,2016,1.01080136588162E+024,NA,NA,10_1080_13658816_2015_1083995

Intrinsically, the rate at which animals expend energy is a key component in understanding how they interact with surrounding environments. Activity, derived through locomotion and basic metabolism, represents the principal energy cost for most animals, although it is rarely quantified in the field. We examined some abiotic drivers of variability in locomotor activity of a free-ranging freshwater predatory fish, Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), for six months using tri-axial accelerometers. Murray cod (n = 20) occupied discrete river reaches and generally exhibited small-scale movements (< 5 km). Activity was highest during crepuscular and nocturnal periods when water temperatures were warmest (19 +/- 30 E degrees C; January +/- March). As water temperatures cooled (9 +/- 21 E degrees C; April +/- June) Murray cod were active throughout the full diel cycle and dormant periods were rarely observed.

Activity peaked during low light levels, at water temperatures of similar to 20 E degrees C, and at discharge rates of similar to 400 ML d(-1).

We hypothesized that overexpression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump (SERCA2a) may improve both contractile dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias. Continuous ECG recordings were obtained in 46 conscious rats after adenoviral gene transfer of either SERCA2a or the reporter gene beta-galactosidase (betagal) or parvalbumin (PV), as early as 48 h before and 48 h after 30 min ligation of the left anterior descending artery by using an implantable telemetry system. Sham-operated animals were used for comparison for hemodynamic measurements, whereas within-animal baseline was used for electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. All episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were counted, and their durations were summed by telemetry. I/R decreased regional cardiac wall thickening as well as the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (+dP/dt) and ventricular pressure fall (-dP/dt). SERCA2a restored regional wall thickening and +dP/dt and -dP/dt to levels seen preoperatively. Regional-wall motion and anterior-wall thickening were improved in the SERCA2a animals, as assessed by echocardiography and piezoelectric crystals. To assess whether these effects are SERCA2a specific, we overexpressed a skeletal-muscle protein, PV, to examine whether Ca2+ buffering alone can mitigate ventricular arrhythmias. During the first hour after I/R, the rate of nonsustained VT plus VF was 16 +/- 5 episodes per h (n = 6) in the Ad.betagal group, 22 +/- 6 in the Ad.PV group, and 4 +/- 2 (n = 6, P < 0.01) in the Ad.SERCA2a group. The decrease in VT plus VF in the Ad.SERCA2a group was consistent throughout the 48 h of monitoring. These results show that improving intracellular Ca2+ handling by overexpression of SERCA2a restores contractile function and reduces ventricular arrhythmias during I/R.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,APR 13,2004,101073pnas0305778101,"Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA./Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA./Gwathmey Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","del Monte, F (reprint author), Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Ctr, 149 13th St,CNY-4, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.",NA

Human 'predators' were asked to 'catch' (mouse-click) prey of different sizes, moving at different speeds across a computer screen. Using the simulation, a prey's chances of escaping predation depended on its speed (faster prey were more difficult to catch than slower prey of the same body size), but also on its size (larger prey were easier to catch than smaller prey at the same speed). Catching time, the time needed to catch a prey, also depended on both prey speed and prey size. Relative prey speed (body lengths/s or body surface/s) was a better predictor of catching time than was absolute prey speed (m/s). Our experiment demonstrates that, in contrast to earlier assertions, per unit body length speed of prey may be more 'ecologically relevant' than absolute speed.

An assumption in standard line transect sampling is that all the animals on the trackline are detected without fail. This assumption tends to be violated for marine mammals with surfacing/diving behaviors. The detection probability on the trackline is estimated using duplicate sightings from double-platform line transect methods. The double-platform methods, however, are insufficient to estimate the abundance of long-diving animals because these animals can be completely missed while the observers pass. We developed a more flexible hazard probability model that incorporates information on surfacing/diving patterns obtained from telemetry data. The model is based on a stochastic point process and is statistically tractable. A simulation study showed that the new model provides near-unbiased abundance estimates, whereas the traditional hazard rate and hazard probability models produce considerably biased estimates.

Monthly abundance surveys conducted inside the FTB between June 2008 and September 2009 showed that shovelnose guitarfish were present throughout the year. Over 96% of the individuals caught were juveniles and these were most abundant in waters between 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Concurrently, 23 shovelnose guitarfish were fitted with coded acoustic transmitters and continuously tracked within the FTB for 16 months. Telemetry data showed individuals remained inside the FTB for, on average, 73.9 days (range 15-172 days), and made few movements between the FTB and the ocean. Tagged individuals disproportionately used mud habitats and waters at temperatures of 22 degrees C, both of which are more common in the FTB than the neighbouring coastal ocean.

We estimated the abundance of the endemic species Mesoclemmys dahli in 2 streams in Cesar, Colombia, from February 2008 to February 2009, by using aquatic sampling. We monitored fluctuations in abundance through the year and used mark recapture sampling and the Jolly Seber model to estimate population size and density. Home ranges and movement patterns were studied by using very high frequency (VHF) radio telemetry. We calculated home ranges for the year and for the wet and dry season independently. Estimated population size for the 2 streams varied during the year from 16 (95% Cl, 7-30) to 175 (95% CI, 32-298) turtles. Densities ranged from 16 turtles/ha in April to approximately 170 turtles/ha in June, which is lower than other populations of M. dahli in Colombia as well as other South American chelids. Individuals captured during the wet season had a significantly higher mean body mass than those captured during the dry season, which suggests that larger animals may leave the streams during the dry months or that animals may lose weight during this period. Home ranges for 1 year varied from 1.6 to 30.8 ha when using the minimum convex polygon method and from 9.2 to 22.5 ha when using the fixed kernel density estimator. There were no significant differences in the mean movements during the dry and wet seasons. However, the greatest movements were documented either during the transition from wet to dry months or during the dry months.

Butterflies were marked individually and the capture position was recorded by GPS. Sex, behaviour and flower visits were also recorded. During the study 852 butterflies were marked and 170 of these were recaptured at least once (recapture rate 20 %), resulting in 1,078 captures (including multiple recaptures). Movement between patches accounted for 41 % of all recaptures and mean distance between recaptures was 112 +/- A 146 m (n = 226). The number of captures was strongly positively correlated with patch size (rho = 0.95, p < 0.05), while the emigrant and immigrant fractions were significantly negatively correlated with patch size.

The order with which the links in a given network are sequentially used, which we call the link order, may be a strong determinant of dynamical behaviour on networks, potentially adding a new dimension to effects of temporal networks relative to static networks. Here we study the effect of the link order on linear coordination (i.e., synchronisation) dynamics. We show that the coordination speed considerably depends on specific orders of links. In addition, applying each single link for a long time to ensure strong pairwise coordination before moving to a next pair of individuals does not often enhance coordination of the entire network. We also implement a simple greedy algorithm to optimise the link order in favour of fast coordination.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,FEB 26,2016,101038srep22105,"[Masuda, Naoki] Univ Bristol, Dept Engn Math, Bristol BS8 1UB, Avon, England.","Masuda, N (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Dept Engn Math, Bristol BS8 1UB, Avon, England.",10_1038_srep22105

This insight should improve our understanding of how changes in the environment affect animal energy budgets and is particularly relevant for animals living near or within human altered environments where habitat change can occur rapidly. We modeled fisher (Pekania pennanti) energy expenditure within their home ranges and investigated the potential environmental and spatial drivers of the predicted spatial patterns. As a proxy for energy expenditure we used overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) that we quantified from tri-axial accelerometer data during the active phases of 12 individuals. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to investigate the spatial distribution of ODBA by associating the acceleration data to the animals' GPS-recorded locations. We related the spatial patterns of ODBA to the utilization distributions and habitat suitability estimates across individuals. The ODBA of fishers appears highly structured in space and was related to individual utilization distribution and habitat suitability estimates. However, we were not able to predict ODBA using the environmental data we selected. Our results suggest an unexpected complexity in the space use of animals that was only captured partially by re-location data-based concepts of home range and habitat suitability. We suggest future studies recognize the limits of ODBA that arise from the fact that acceleration is often collected at much finer spatio-temporal scales than the environmental data and that ODBA lacks a behavioral correspondence. Overcoming these limits would improve the interpretation of energy expenditure in relation to the environment.",NA,FEB 3,2016,101371journalpone0145732,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0145732

Most studies use low-frequency (<= 32 Hz) accelerometer sampling because of battery and data-archiving constraints. In this study we assessed the effect of sampling frequency (aliasing) on activity detection probability using the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthoceaphalus) as a model species. Feeding strikes and escape responses (fast-start activities) and spontaneous movements among seven different great sculpin were triggered, observed and recorded using video records and a tri-axial accelerometer sampling at 100 Hz. We demonstrate that multiple parameters in the time and probability domains can statistically differentiate between activities with high detection (90%) and identification (80%) probabilities. Detection probability for feeding and escape activities decreased by 50% when sampling at <10 Hz. Our analyses illustrate additional problems associated with aliasing and how activity and energy-budget estimates can be compromised and misinterpreted. We recommend that high-frequency (>30 Hz) accelerometer sampling be used in similar laboratory and field studies. If battery and/or data storage is limited, we also recommend archiving the events via an on-board algorithm that determines the highest likelihood and subsequent archiving of the various event classes of interest.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,APR,2013,101242jeb077396,"[Broell, Franziska; Auclair, Jean-Pierre; Taggart, Christopher T.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada./[Noda, Takuji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Social Informat, Kyoto 6068501, Japan./[Wright, Serena] CEFAS Lab, Lowestoft NR3 0HT, Suffolk, England./[Wright, Serena] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci & Geog, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales./[Steffensen, John Fleng] CNR IAMC, Ist Ambiente Marino Costiero, I-09072 Localita Sa Mardini, Torregrande Ori, Italy./[Domenici, Paolo] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Lab, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark.","Broell, F (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",NA

However, there has yet to be a comprehensive examination of these data in cancer survivors, including short-and long-term survivors of all cancer types. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to use these data to describe activity behaviors in short-and long-term cancer survivors of various types. A secondary aim was to compare activity patterns of cancer survivors to that of the general population. Cancer survivors (n = 508) and age-matched individuals not diagnosed with cancer (n = 1,016) were identified from a subsample of adults with activity measured by accelerometer. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were summarized across cancer type and demographics; multivariate regression was used to evaluate differences between survivors and those not diagnosed with cancer. On average, cancer survivors were 61.4 (95% CI: 59.6, 63.2) years of age; 57% were female. Physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns varied by cancer diagnosis, demographic variables, and time since diagnosis. Survivors performed 307 min/day of light-intensity physical activity (95% CI: 295, 319), 16 min/day of moderate-vigorous intensity activity (95% CI: 14, 17); only 8% met physical activity recommendations. These individuals also reported 519 (CI: 506, 532) minutes of sedentary time, with 86 (CI: 84, 88) breaks in sedentary behavior per day. Compared to non-cancer survivors, after adjustment for potential confounders, survivors performed less light-intensity activity (P = 0.01), were more sedentary (P = 0.01), and took fewer breaks in sedentary time (P = 0.04), though there were no differences in any other activity variables. These results suggest that cancer survivors are insufficiently active. Relative to adults of similar age not diagnosed with cancer, they engage in more sedentary time with fewer breaks. As such, sedentary behavior and light-intensity activity may be important intervention targets, particularly for those for whom moderate-to-vigorous activity is not well accepted.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,AUG 14,2017,101371journalpone0182554,"[Thraen-Borowski, Keith M.] Loras Coll, Dept Kinesiol, Dubuque, IA USA./[Thraen-Borowski, Keith M.] Loras Coll, Dept Biol, Dubuque, IA USA./[Thraen-Borowski, Keith M.; Cadmus-Bertram, Lisa] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Kinesiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA./[Gennuso, Keith P.] Univ Wisconsin, Populat Hlth Inst, Madison, WI USA./[Cadmus-Bertram, Lisa] Univ Wisconsin, Paul P Carbone Comprehens Canc Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","Cadmus-Bertram, L (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Kinesiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Cadmus-Bertram, L (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Paul P Carbone Comprehens Canc Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0182554

To date, most GPS location schedules have been set at regular intervals. If intervals are too long, they undersample the details of movement paths, and if too short, they oversample resting sites and deplete the unit's battery without providing new information. We address this problem by creating a dynamic GPS schedule that is linked to the activity level of the animal via an accelerometer onboard the tracking tag. We deployed traditional and accelerometer-informed GPS tags on northern tamanduas anteater (Tamandua mexicana) in tropical forest in the Republic of Panama (2009-2010), and on fisher (Martes pennanti) in temperate forest in New York, USA (2009-2011). These species are medium-sized forest-dwellers that frequently use tree cavities, ground burrows, and thick vegetation for resting and foraging, all traits that make them particularly challenging for GPS tracking. The accelerometer-informed tags performed better than the traditional GPS tags: they attempted 73.6% more locations per day, achieved 61.7% higher location success rates, spent 28.2% less time searching for satellites, made 67.4% fewer redundant location attempts in places where animals were inactive, and ultimately provided more data for a given battery size. The resulting tracks of animal movement had high temporal resolution, revealing aspects of their behavior and ecology that would have been missed by traditional tags, especially for the fast-moving fisher. By dynamically linking the location schedule to animal movement rate, accelerometer-informed GPS tags reduce the trade-off between collecting detailed movement data and recording movement data for a longer period of time.

Here, we show that simple methods can also be used to identify elephant activity levels and body orientation. Subjects were 6 African elephants: 3 at Disney's Animal Kingdom (R), Florida, USA, and 3 in Samburu-Laikipia, Kenya. Each elephant wore a collar containing a tri-axial ac celerometer positioned on top of the neck. Simultaneous video recordings allowed validation of accelerometer data against observed behavior. The standard deviation of the total acceleration was shown to be a valid measure of dynamic acceleration, differentiating activity levels associated with resting, feeding, bathing, walking, and rapid walking. The mean of the total acceleration was shown to be a valid measure of static acceleration, and indicated upright and recumbent orientations. Simulations showed how accuracy was affected by sample rate, number of axes examined, and analysis window lengths. Based on 34 continuous 24 h acceleration streams, the 6 elephants exhibited an average of 2.5 h of overnight recumbence associated with minimal movement, indicating sleep. Daily activity budgets exhibited periods of minimal activity (e.g. resting, 17%), low activity (e.g. feeding, 68%), medium activity (e.g. walking, 13%), and high activity (e.g. rapid walking, 2%). Kenyan elephants were slightly more active and exhibited less restful recumbence compared to zoo elephants.

Estimating the metabolic rate of animals in nature is central to understanding the physiological, behavioural and evolutionary ecology of animals. Doubly labelled water and heart-rate methods are the most commonly used approaches, but both have limitations that preclude their application to some systems.
2. Accelerometry has emerged as a powerful tool for estimating energy expenditure in a range of animals, but is yet to be used to estimate field metabolic rate in aquatic taxa. We combined two-dimensional accelerometry and swim-tunnel respirometry to estimate patterns of energy expenditure in giant Australian cuttlefish Sepia apama during breeding.
3. Both oxygen consumption rate ((V) over doto(2)) and swimming speed showed strong positive associations with body acceleration, with coefficients of determination comparable to those using similar accelerometers on terrestrial vertebrates. Despite increased activity during the day, field metabolic rate rarely approached (V) over doto(2), and night-time (V) over doto(2) was similar to that at rest.
4. These results are consistent with the life-history strategy of this species, which has a poor capacity to exercise anaerobically, and a mating strategy that is visually based. With the logistical difficulties associated with observation in aquatic environments, accelerometry is likely to prove a valuable tool for estimating energy expenditure in aquatic animals.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,MAR,2011,101111j13652656201001758x,"[Payne, Nicholas L.; Gillanders, Bronwyn M.; Seymour, Roger S.; Snelling, Edward P.] Univ Adelaide, So Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia./[Webber, Dale M.] Amirix Syst Inc, Vemco, Halifax, NS, Canada./[Semmens, Jayson M.] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Aquaculture & Fisheries Inst, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.","Payne, NL (reprint author), Univ Adelaide, So Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",NA

Because metabolism is often closely correlated with mechanical work, accelerometers have the potential to provide detailed information on energy expenditure of wild animals over fine temporal scales. Nonetheless, accelerometry needs to be validated on wild animals, especially across different locomotory modes. We merged data collected on 20 thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) from miniature accelerometers with measurements of daily energy expenditure over 24 h using doubly labelled water. Across three different locomotory modes (swimming, flying and movement on land), dynamic body acceleration was a good predictor of daily energy expenditure as measured independently by doubly labelled water (R-2 = 0.73). The most parsimonious model suggested that different equations were needed to predict energy expenditure from accelerometry for flying than for surface swimming or activity on land (R-2 = 0.81).

Breeding success, survival, adult mass, and nestling mass were not affected by tagging, and there were no differences in trip metrics, ODBA, and flapping frequency for birds tagged with GPS and accelerometer packages vs. only accelerometers. However, accelerometry revealed that, when tagged for 3 days with GPS and accelerometer tags, kittiwakes reduced the amount of time spent flying by 30%. Impacts of short-term tag deployments were detected by measuring metrics over the same short timescale, rather than through measurement of long-term metrics. We suggest that tagging birds alters their behavior, but that such effects may not be detected using coarse-scale measures, such as reproductive success, survival, and body mass, due to behavioral accommodation.

When double integrating the raw sensor data, multiple error sources are also integrated, producing inaccuracies in the final position estimation which increases fast with the integration time. In this paper, we make a systematic and experimental comparison of different methods for position estimation, with different sensors and in different motion conditions. The objective is to correlate practical factors that appear in real applications, such as motion mean velocity, path length, calibration method, or accelerometer noise level, with the quality of the estimation. The results confirm that it is possible to use accelerometers to estimate short linear displacements of the body with a typical error of around 4.5% in the general conditions tested in this study. However, they also show that the motion kinematic conditions can be a key factor in the performance of this estimation, as the dynamic response of the accelerometer can affect the final results.

Such separation often leads to distress in the foal, as evidenced by behavioural indicators such as vocalisations, pacing or moving about, pawing and striking the body against solid objects. This study examined whether the foal's distress is reduced if a handler accompanies it during the period of separation. A total of 57 foals on an Irish stud farm were observed: 27 foals were accompanied during separation and 30 were left in isolation but discretely observed from outside the stall. On average, unaccompanied foals vocalised at significantly (P < 0.001) shorter intervals (14.8 s versus 26.8 s), and spent significantly (P < 0.05) more time pawing (29.6 s versus 6.8 s) than accompanied ones. In addition, 17 of the unaccompanied foals hurled themselves against a solid object on at least one occasion, while not one of the accompanied foals did this (P < 0.001). Age, gender and number of times the foal had been previously separated from the mare while she was being teased or covered were not significantly related to any of the behavioural indicators of distress. Overall, the data provide clear evidence that accompanying a foal reduces the distress that it exhibits when separated from the mare. This procedure has obvious welfare benefits in the short term, in that the foal both experiences less distress and has a reduced likelihood of injuring itself, and it may have longer-term benefits by reducing the chance of the animal later developing a locomotory stereotypical behaviour.

Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difficult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to fit the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the definition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. Using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a fixed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefficient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,DEC,2009,1018900808741,"[Forester, James D.; Im, Hae Kyung; Rathouz, Paul J.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Integrating Stat & Environm Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA./[Rathouz, Paul J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Hlth Studies, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","Forester, JD (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",NA

Telemetry transmitters offer field ecologists the opportunity to observe mortality events in cases as the absence of animal movement. When observations of mortality are based on factors such as the absence of animal movement, live individuals can be mistaken for dead, resulting in biased estimates of survival. Additionally, tag failure or emigration might also influence estimates of survival in telemetry studies. Failing to account for mis-classification, tag failure, and emigration rates can result in overestimates of mortality rates by up two-fold, even when the data are corrected for obviously mistaken entries. We use a multi-state capture-recapture model with a misclassification parameter in estimating both the rate of permanent emigration and/or tag failure and the rate at which individuals are mistakenly identified as dead. We use this method on an annual telemetry survey of three species of native fish in the Murray river, Australia: Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua). Evidence for higher mortality rates in the first year post-implantation occurred for Murray cod and golden perch, which is likely an effect of tagging and/or the transmitter, or transmitters shedding. Using simulations, we confirm that our model approach is robust to a broad range of misclassification and transmitter failure rates. With these simulations we also demonstrate that misclassification models that do not account for emigration will likely be erroneous if live and dead animals have different probabilities of detection. These findings will have a broad interest to ecologists wishing to account for multiple sources of misclassification error in capture-mark-recapture studies, with the caveat that the specifics of the approach are dependent on species, transmitter types and other aspects of experimental design which may or may not be amenable to the misclassification framework.

Animal telemetry technology has revolutionized the fields of ecology and conservation biology by providing high quality spatial data on animal movement. Radio-telemetry with very high frequency (VHF) radio signals continues to be a useful technology because of its low cost, miniaturization, and low battery requirements. Despite a number of statistical developments synthetically integrating animal location estimation and uncertainty with spatial process models using satellite telemetry data, we are unaware of similar developments for azimuthal telemetry data. As such, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models.
We developed a hierarchical modeling framework to provide robust animal location estimates from one or more intersecting or non-intersecting azimuths. We used our azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into spatial ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators (Lenth (1981) maximum likelihood and M-Estimators) using simulation. We also provide illustrative empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We further use simulation to better understand the relationship among location uncertainty, spatial covariate autocorrelation, and resource selection inference.
Results: We found the ATM to have good performance in estimating locations and the only model that has appropriate measures of coverage. Ignoring animal location uncertainty when estimating resource selection or home ranges can have pernicious effects on ecological inference. Home range estimates can be overly confident and conservative when ignoring location uncertainty and resource selection coefficients can lead to incorrect inference and over confidence in the magnitude of selection. Furthermore, our simulation study clarified that incorporating location uncertainty helps reduce bias in resource selection coefficients across all levels of covariate spatial autocorrelation.
Conclusion: The ATM can accommodate one or more azimuths when estimating animal locations, regardless of how they intersect; this ensures that all data collected are used for ecological inference. Our findings and model development have important implications for interpreting historical analyses using this type of data and the future design of radio-telemetry studies.",BMC,JUL 25,2018,101186s4046201801291,"[Gerber, Brian D.; Peck, Christopher P.] Colorado State Univ, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fish Wildlife &Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA./[Gerber, Brian D.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA./[Hooten, Mevin B.] Colorado State Univ, US Geol Survey, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA./[Hooten, Mevin B.] Colorado State Univ, US Geol Survey, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Stat, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA./[Rice, Mindy B.; Gammonley, James H.] Colorado Div Pk & Wildlife, 317 West Prospect, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA./[Apa, Anthony D.] Colorado Div Pk & Wildlife, 711 Independent Ave, Grand Junction, CO 81505 USA./[Davis, Amy J.] USDA, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, 4101 Laporte Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.","Gerber, BD (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fish Wildlife &Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.; Gerber, BD (reprint author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",10_1186_s40462_018_0129_1

Such estimates are paramount for generating reliable estimates of animal abundance and are sometimes of biological interest in their own right (e.g. for characterizing pinniped haul-out behaviour or landbird singing frequency). We consider the estimation of availability probability from telemetry data when there are missing records. When records are missing-completely-at-random (i.e. not influenced by whether an animal is available for sampling or other covariates), approaches that censor missing records result in unbiased estimates of availability probability. However, censoring such records can result in bias when data are not missing-completely-at-random. We present a novel Bayesian temporal availability model that can be used to explicitly account for the process by which missing data arise. Our approach couples an underlying model for the partially observed availability process together with an observation model that allows state-dependent probabilities of missingness. This approach provides relatively unbiased estimates of availability probability even in the face of violations of the missing-at-random assumption. A new R package, TempOcc, is introduced to automate estimation. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analysing both simulated data and hourly satellite telemetry records for 157 ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea, for which 27% of records were missing. In this case, we were interested in generating unbiased estimates of haul-out probabilities. Such probabilities are necessary when estimating abundance from aerial survey counts and assessing possible changes in seal phenology. Our analysis indicates that the missing-at-random assumption is indeed violated in telemetry studies of phocid seals in the Bering Sea. However, estimates of availability probability do not depend critically on this assumption. We recommend that ecologists routinely consider the implications of violating the missing-at-random assumption when estimating availability probabilities. Where possible, the modelling framework articulated in this study can be used to diagnose and correct for violations of the missing-at-random assumption.",WILEY,DEC,2012,101111j2041210X201200238x,"[Conn, Paul B.; Johnson, Devin S.; London, Josh M.; Boveng, Peter L.] NOAA, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","Conn, PB (reprint author), NOAA, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",NA

Despite their widespread use, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques. To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location provided by the PSATs was 5.16 degrees latitude and 2.00 degrees longitude. Estimates were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE = 2.97 degrees latitude and 0.78 degrees longitude) and most accurate after processing with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE = 1.84 degrees latitude and 0.78 degrees longitude).

ARGOS location estimates do not include complete error estimations, and for many marine organisms, the most commonly acquired locations (Location Class 0, A, B, or Z) are provided with no declared error estimate.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the accuracy of ARGOS locations to those obtained using Fastloc GPS from the same electronic tags on five species of pinnipeds: 9 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), 4 Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), 6 Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), 3 Australian fur seals (A. p. doriferus) and 5 northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). These species encompass a range of marine habitats (highly pelagic vs coastal), diving behaviors (mean dive durations 2-21 min) and range of latitudes (equator to temperate). A total of 7,318 ARGOS positions and 27,046 GPS positions were collected. Of these, 1,105 ARGOS positions were obtained within five minutes of a GPS position and were used for comparison. The 68(th) percentile ARGOS location errors as measured in this study were LC-3 0.49 km, LC-2 1.01 km, LC-1 1.20 km, LC-0 4.18 km, LC-A 6.19 km, LC-B 10.28 km.
Conclusions/Significance: The ARGOS errors measured here are greater than those provided by ARGOS, but within the range of other studies. The error was non-normally distributed with each LC highly right-skewed. Locations of species that make short duration dives and spend extended periods on the surface (sea lions and fur seals) had less error than species like elephant seals that spend more time underwater and have shorter surface intervals.

This typically involves animals being captured, individually marked, then released and later detected by capture or resighting. This may be stressful for individual animals and can be resource-intensive. Photo-identification has emerged as an effective, and potentially less intrusive, alternative to traditional mark-recapture methods. Photo-identification can be used when animals have stable and individually identifiable natural markings that can be photographed in the field and used for long-term identification. A database of photographs and associated capture-history data can be used for robust estimation of demographic parameters such as population size and survival if an appropriate sampling regime is used. In addition, aspects of behavioural ecology, habitat use, movement patterns and home range can be examined. We outline the creation of a photographic database for jewelled geckos (Naultinus gemmeus) from Otago Peninsula and test the accuracy and speed with which human observers can use this database to differentiate between individual jewelled geckos.

Herein, we propose a novel method for accurate 3D orientation estimation using an AHRS, comprised of an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, under conditions of magnetic field distortion. The system performs online detection and compensation for magnetic disturbances, due to, for example, the presence of ferrous objects. The magnetic distortions are detected by exploiting variations in magnetic dip angle, relative to the gravity vector, and in magnetic strength. We investigate and show the advantages of using both magnetic strength and magnetic dip angle for detecting the presence of magnetic distortions. The correction method is based on a particle filter, which performs the correction using an adaptive cost function and by adapting the variance during particle resampling, so as to place more emphasis on the results of dead reckoning of the gyroscope measurements and less on the magnetometer readings. The proposed method was tested in an indoor environment in the presence of various magnetic distortions and under various accelerations (up to 3 g). In the experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves <2 degrees static peak-to-peak error and <5 degrees dynamic peak-to-peak error, significantly outperforming previous methods.",MDPI AG,NOV,2014,103390s141120008,"[Yadav, Nagesh; Bleakley, Chris] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland.","Yadav, N (reprint author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland.",4279468

Echolocation clicks were produced with a mean inter-click interval of approximately 300 ms and peak frequency of 25 kHz. Two deep dives included presumed foraging behavior, with echolocation pulsed sounds (presumed prey capture attempts) associated with increased maneuvering, and sustained inverted swimming during the bottom phase of the dive. A controlled exposure to simulated mid-frequency active sonar (3.5-4 kHz) was conducted 4 hours after tag deployment, and within 3 minutes of exposure onset, the tagged whale increased swim speed and body movement, and continued to show unusual dive behavior for each of its next three dives, one of each type.

In this study, acoustic capture-recapture by combining a double-observer method with line transect sampling was performed to observe Yangtze finless porpoises. Two acoustic devices were towed with the distance between them varying 0.5 to 89.5 m. The conditional probabilities that both devices would detect the porpoises within the same time window were calculated. In a 1-s time window, it became smaller as the distance between the devices increased, approaching zero when the distance between them was more than 50 m. It was considered that the devices with less than 50m distance detected the same signals from the same animals, which means the identical detection. When the distance between them is too great, the recapture rate is reduced and the incidence of false matching may increase. Thus, a separation distance of around 50m between two devices in acoustic capture-recapture of Yangtze finless porpoises was recommended. Note that the performance of the double detections can change depending on the particular device used and on animal behaviors such as vocalizing interval, ship avoidance.

The first species, Hemimysis speluncola(<1 cm length), lives in the submarine cave, forming a distinct community that migrates horizontally. The second species, Siriella jaltensis (>1 cm length), lives in the open sea and migrates vertically. These species are both detected clearly at 120 kHz, but only the larger one, Siriella jaltensis, is detected at 38 kHz. This distinction allows one to determine the size limits of planktonic objects detected at these frequencies, i.e. 3 mm at 120 kHz and 10 mm at 38 kHz, corresponding to one quarter of the wavelength. The target strength (TS) of each species was calculated from the field data and compared to results calculated from three models. As the volume of the cave occupied by the Hemimysis population is about 300 m(3), and the density of the swarm is 36,000 individuals/m(3), the number of individuals in the cave is estimated to be around 10 million (or 24 kg). The density of the open-water population of Siriella is estimated to be 13 individuals/m(3). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

High-flying, open-space foragers are especially underrepresented by mist-net surveys. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of using acoustic lures (playbacks of conspecific vocalizations) to increase capture success of bats in mist nets. We tested the efficacy of an acoustic lure to capture a high-flying rare molossid, the endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus), which had been captured only once away from a known roost prior to our research. We used a crossover experimental design with 2 lure treatments (nets with lures playing social call recordings from 2 different roosts) and 2 control nets (no lures) in 6 sites for 2 nights each. We captured 15 Florida bonneted bats in our treatment nets and 0 in our control nets. One lure had greater capture success (n=13) than the other (n=2), with a trend for greater captures of males (n=11) than females (n=4). We suggest that these differences were due to the social context in which the calls used in the lures were recorded. Our study demonstrated the utility of acoustic lures to capture Florida bonneted bats and expands research opportunities critical to the species' conservation, such as the ability to use radio telemetry to track captured bats to unknown roosting and foraging areas. Our study also lays the foundation for future research into social call playbacks as a technique to lure other high-flying and elusive bat species into mist nets.

However, the study of movement behavior in marine fishes has been historically difficult and typically produces a limited amount of data (i.e., start and end points). We use an array of automated acoustic receivers to monitor autumn and winter movement patterns of sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus (Bonnaterre, 1788)) in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Daily movement of sharks and maximum distance moved from tagging sites varied with size, with larger sharks having shorter daily movements and maximum distances from tagging locations than smaller sharks. Sharks were detected at the same site as the previous day 76% of the time. Movement away from the shark's tagging location increased slightly over the duration of the study, but most sharks occupied the same sites for most of the study. These relatively small and stable movement patterns could lead to localized, top-down impacts from sixgill sharks and suggest that local human perturbations, such as fishing or pollution, have the potential to negatively affect local populations of sixgill sharks.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",NOV,2007,101139Z07088,"[Andrews, K.

The instrument was deployed when the euphausiids were at depth during the day and during dusk periods of population ascent. Three-dimensional swimming paths of individual euphausiids were reconstructed by linking successive, acoustically-determined positions. Median swimming speeds were 1.8 cm s(-1) during the day and 2.2-3.5 cm s(-1) during dusk periods of vertical ascent. The presence of a fish at distances of 20-300 cm did not affect the swimming speed or turning of the euphausiids, suggesting that they did not respond to the presence of a potential predator at these distances. Euphausiids moved primarily obliquely in the vertical plane, with few individuals moving directly up or down, even during periods of vertical migration at dusk. We hypothesize that oblique swimming trajectories of euphausiids may reduce vulnerability to visual predators by allowing them to maintain bioluminescent counter-illumination during vertical migration.

Some effects have been discovered by observing coincidence of effects with sound exposure, e.g. beaked whales such as Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon densirostris may mass strand during sonar exercises. Sometimes new activities trigger precautionary concern, such as the potential effects of deep water seismic surveys on deep-diving endangered species, e.g. sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus. In both cases, the best way to prove that a particular sound stimulus causes a behavioral response involves experiments whereby a specific dose of sound is broadcast to an animal and the acoustic exposure and behavioral responses of the animal are measured.

The bulk of targets, recorded by acoustics and direct capture. consisted both of fish 3-4 cm long and insect larvae 0.2-1 cm long. Diurnal patterns of behavior were very distinct: during the daytime, invertebrates were hidden in the bottom and most fish stayed in compact shoals. Time course of acoustic fish biomass and abundance was very variable due to shoaling. Only the largest fish were recorded as solitary targets. At night, the whole acoustic range was filled with targets and the time course of fish biomass (5-15 kg ha(-1)) and abundance (20-45 thousand individuals ha(-1)) were more constant. The biomass increased mostly at surface layers. Fish appeared in the evening in the water column 1 h earlier and stayed there in the morning 1 h longer than invertebrates. Dawn and dusk are good periods for studying fish before invertebrates outnumber them. Apart from fish, according to the target strength, swimming speed and depth distribution, at least four groups of water invertebrates were distinguished acoustically, some with extremely fast vertical movement (7-9 cm s(-1) vertical speed).

The absence of sharks at the surface during visual surveys has led to the assumption that sharks disperse to places unknown during the long 'off-seasons' at most of these locations. Here we compare 2 years of R. typus visual sighting records from Mafia Island in Tanzania to concurrent acoustic telemetry of tagged individuals. Sightings revealed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak between October and February and no sharks observed at other times. By contrast, acoustic telemetry demonstrated year-round residency of R. typus. The sharks use a different habitat in the off-season, swimming deeper and further away from shore, presumably in response to prey distributions. This behavioural change reduces the sharks' visibility, giving the false impression that they have left the area. We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, year-round residency of unprovisioned, individual R. typus at an aggregation site, and highlight the importance of using multiple techniques to study the movement ecology of marine megafauna.",ROYAL SOC,APR 1,2015,101098rsbl20150092,"[Cagua, E.

Nine fish were tracked on coral reef habitats off La Parguera, Puerto Rico, April-May 1989. Combined distances traversed and acoustic contact time for all nine were 3.6 km and 117.5 h, respectively. Total contact times ranged from 8-20 h per individual; two fish exhibited behaviours considered to be dusk/dawn migrations in three episodes for distances of 100-530 m; two episodes were probably associated with nocturnal foraging. One fish transferred 1 km from one reef to another and did not return across deep water to its home reef. Five fish were tracked on patch reef habitats surrounded by seagrass meadows in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, Florida, May-June 1990. Combined distances and contact time were 2.8 km and 71.5 h, respectively. Total contact times ranged from 6.5 to 17.5 h per individual; three fish exhibited behaviours considered to be dusk/dawn migrations in seven episodes for distances of 130-560 m; five of these episodes were probably related to nocturnal foraging and two were between patch reefs. One individual displaced to seagrass meadow 290 m from its daytime resting patch reef, 'homed' directly back to its capture site within 30 min of release. In Puerto Rico and Florida the majority of contacts were categorized as sedentary or roaming, the latter being meandering movements usually within 100 m of the animal's apparent home within each reef complex. Movements of adult white grunt differed from published accounts of juveniles with respect to timing and frequency; off-reef migrations were initiated at irregular times and did not occur as regularly as those in younger fish, yet the essential character of nocturnal or crepuscular migration was maintained, suggesting that a significant behavioural change takes place with increasing size or maturity.

Between spawning events, horseshoe crabs remained 50-715 m offshore(x= 299m,SE 57 m) from their established spawning beaches. Following the new moon, all but one (96%) moved out of range of our survey area, which extended approximately I km from the shoreline. Multistate mark-recapture models were used to estimate recapture probabilities and daily probabilities of spawning and departure from the vicinity of the spawning beaches. The probability of recapture by acoustic telemetry was high and estimated to be 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-0.99). Horseshoe crabs equipped with acoustic and radio transmitters have high rates of recapture, can be tracked continually, and can be relocated in both foreshore and inshore habitats.",WILEY,NOV,2004,10157715488675200424<1376AAROHC>20CO2,"Cornell Cooperat Extens, Marine Program, Centerport, NY 11721 USA./US Geol Survey, Leetown Sci Ctr, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA./Delaware Dept Nat Resources & Environm Control, Dover, DE 19901 USA.","Brousseau, LJ (reprint author), Cornell Cooperat Extens, Marine Program, 180 Little Neck Rd, Centerport, NY 11721 USA.",NA

A hierarchical Bayesian state-space model of movement was subsequently developed to associate the behaviors of tagged salmon with characteristics of benthic habitat in the enclosure. Model results indicated that smolts had a strong preference for remaining in native eelgrass (Zostera marina). Conversely, no such preference existed for other structured benthic habitats such as oyster (Crassostrea gigas) beds, non-native eelgrass (Zostera japonica), and non-native smooth crodgrass (Spartina alterniflora).

Active sensing can facilitate this process by engaging motor systems in the sampling of sensory information. The echolocating bat serves as an excellent model to investigate the coupling between action and sensing because it adaptively controls both the acoustic signals used to probe the environment and movements to receive echoes at the auditory periphery. We report here that the echolocating bat controls the features of its sonar vocalizations in tandem with the positioning of the outer ears to maximize acoustic cues for target detection and localization. The bat's adaptive control of sonar vocalizations and ear positioning occurs on a millisecond timescale to capture spatial information from arriving echoes, as well as on a longer timescale to track target movement. Our results demonstrate that purposeful control over sonar sound production and reception can serve to improve acoustic cues for localization tasks.

We acoustically detected thousands of bubble trails that were strongly correlated with the number of visually detected murres, providing a new tool for quantitatively studying the foraging ecology of diving birds. At the regional scale, the number of acoustically detected bubble trails, which served as a proxy for diving murre abundance, was related to the combined availability and vertical accessibility of squid, krill, and pollock. There were, however, no clear relationships at this scale between diving murres and any individual prey taxon, highlighting the importance of prey diversity to these animals. Individual krill patches targeted by murres had higher krill density and were located shallower than the mean depth of krill patches, but were similar in total krill abundance and overall size. The diving depth of murres within krill patches was highly correlated to the depth of the upper edge of these patches, whereas murres found outside of krill patches showed a depth distribution similar to that of juvenile pollock. Throughout the study area, murres showed strong diel patterns in their diving behavior in response to the diel migrations of their prey. These results suggest that murres select prey with specific patch characteristics implying effective information gathering about prey by murres. The high proportion of diving murres in aggregations and their consistent inter-individual spacing support the hypothesis that intra-specific local enhancement may facilitate foraging in these predators.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2011,103354meps09408,"[Benoit-Bird, Kelly J.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA./[Kuletz, Kathy] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA./[Heppell, Scott] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA./[Jones, Nathan; Hoover, Brian] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.","Benoit-Bird, KJ (reprint author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, 104 COAS Adm Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",10_3354_meps09408

Recent studies have shown that at least one bat species, the Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), produces specialized social signals that disrupt the sonar of conspecific competitors. We herein discuss the differences between passive and active jamming signals and test whether heterospecific jamming occurs in species overlapping spatiotemporally, as well as whether such interference elicits a jamming avoidance response. We compare the capture rates of tethered moths and the echolocation parameters of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) challenged with the playback of the jamming signal normally produced by Brazilian free-tailed bats and playback of deconstructed versions of this signal. There were no differences in the capture rates of targets with and without the jamming signal, although significant changes in both spectral and temporal features of the bats' echolocation were observed. These changes are consistent with improvements of the signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of acoustic interference. Accordingly, we propose to expand the traditional definition of the jamming avoidance response, stating that echolocation changes in response to interference should decrease similarity between the two signals, to include any change that increases the ability to separate returning echoes from active jamming stimuli originating from conspecific and heterospecific organisms. Flexibility in echolocation is an important characteristic for overcoming various forms of acoustic interference and may serve a purpose in interspecific interactions as well as intraspecific ones.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,AUG,2018,101242jeb176511,"[Jones, Te K.; Conner, William E.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA./[Wohlgemuth, Melville J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","Jones, TK (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",NA

They may also direct specific maternal activities towards the brood (active brood care). We show that Crangonyx pseudogracilis, which typically populates freshwaters subject to wide fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen, engages in a highly responsive form of active brood care. This involves a flexing motion by the female that expands the brood pouch and increases the suspension of the eggs in the surrounding medium, accompanied by ventilation of the brood pouch and the 'cycling' of eggs therein. Females also selectively eject nonviable eggs from their broods. We investigated the expression of this brood care behaviour in relation to intrinsic and extrinsic factors relevant to the development of broods. The time spent by females in this behaviour initially increased as embryos developed, but decreased once advanced embryos began to self-ventilate and to have a heart pulse. In addition, both increased temperature and decreased oxygen concentration resulted in increased levels of brooding behaviour. We thus propose that this behaviour functions to ameliorate the microclimate of the brood pouch and serves the changing metabolic demand of the brood, as influenced by the interaction of embryonic development with temperature/dissolved oxygen regime. In addition, this behaviour may be a key adaptation facilitating the success of this North American species as an invader of disturbed and polluted freshwaters in Europe and elsewhere; Evidence is emerging that other amphipods associated with harsh environmental conditions also shaw such active maternal brood care.

Here, we addressed this question by studying echolocating bats, animals that have the ability to point their biosonar beam to a confined region of space. We trained Egyptian fruit bats to land on a target, under conditions of varying levels of environmental complexity, and measured their echolocation and flight behavior. The bats modulated the intensity of their biosonar emissions, and the spatial region they sampled, in a task-dependant manner. We report here that Egyptian fruit bats selectively change the emission intensity and the angle between the beam axes of sequentially emitted clicks, according to the distance to the target, and depending on the level of environmental complexity. In so doing, they effectively adjusted the spatial sector sampled by a pair of clicks-the ""field-of-view."" We suggest that the exact point within the beam that is directed towards an object (e.g., the beam's peak, maximal slope, etc.) is influenced by three competing task demands: detection, localization, and angular scanning-where the third factor is modulated by field-of-view. Our results suggest that lingual echolocation (based on tongue clicks) is in fact much more sophisticated than previously believed. They also reveal a new parameter under active control in animal sonar-the angle between consecutive beams. Our findings suggest that acoustic scanning of space by mammals is highly flexible and modulated much more selectively than previously recognized.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SEP,2011,101371journalpbio1001150,"[Yovel, Yossi; Ulanovsky, Nachum] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel./[Falk, Ben; Moss, Cynthia F.] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Syst Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA./[Falk, Ben; Moss, Cynthia F.] Univ Maryland, Neurosci & Cognit Sci Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","Yovel, Y (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",10_1371_journal_pbio_1001150

When the bat encountered the difficult task of taking insects as close as 10 - 20 cm from the vegetation, its behavior changed significantly from that under open room conditions.

However, an animal's own movement also determines the spatial and temporal dynamics of sensory feedback. Because each sensory modality has unique spatiotemporal properties, movement has differential and potentially independent effects on each sensory system. Here we show that weakly electric fish dramatically adjust their locomotor behavior in relation to changes of modality-specific information in a task in which increasing sensory volume is irrelevant. We varied sensory information during a refuge-tracking task by changing illumination (vision) and conductivity (electroreception). The gain between refuge movement stimuli and fish tracking responses was functionally identical across all sensory conditions. However, there was a significant increase in the tracking error in the dark (no visual cues). This was a result of spontaneous whole-body oscillations (0.1 to 1. Hz) produced by the fish. These movements were costly: in the dark, fish swam over three times further when tracking and produced more net positive mechanical work. The magnitudes of these oscillations increased as electrosensory salience was degraded via increases in conductivity. In addition, tail bending (1.5 to 2.35. Hz), which has been reported to enhance electrosensory perception, occurred only during trials in the dark. These data show that both categories of movements - whole-body oscillations and tail bends - actively shape the spatiotemporal dynamics of electrosensory feedback.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,MAY,2012,101242jeb068007,"[Stamper, Sarah A.; Fortune, Eric S.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA./[Roth, Eatai; Cowan, Noah J.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","Stamper, SA (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",NA

This approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead, in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework. However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for successful model parameterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we outline the development of this rapidly evolving field and formulate the studies conducted that utilize this technology. To date, more than 60 studies have been conducted using EMG telemetry that spans 18 species. Several general trends were observed in the methodology of the studies that we have highlighted as standards that should be adopted associated with transmitter customization, electrode placement and surgical technique. Although numerous studies have been methodological, there are still some deficiencies in our basic understanding of issues such as the need for individual calibration and the method of reporting or transforming data. Increasingly, this technology is being applied to address issues in conservation, management and aquaculture production. At present, the technology has been most frequently applied to the study of animal activity or energetics and to migration. Several recent studies have also focused on addressing more basic questions in ecological and evolutionary biology (e.g. parental care dynamics) similar to the large body of literature that has been collected for other taxa (e.g. marine mammals, birds), using activity telemetry. Collectively, studies conducted using EMG telemetry have contributed important information on free-swimming fish that was previously difficult to obtain. EMG telemetry is particularly effective for examining behaviour at temporal and spatial scales that are difficult using other techniques. The development of an ultrasonic transmitter based on the same proven principles as those used in the current radio transmitter technology will permit studies in other environments (i.e. marine, brackish, deep water) and on different species of fish. We encourage the continued development and refinement of devices for monitoring the activity and energetics of free-swimming fish, and also encourage researchers to consider EMG telemetry as a tool for addressing questions that are not effectively answered with other techniques.",BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,MAR,2004,101111j14672960200400136x,"Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada./Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA./Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.","Cooke, SJ (reprint author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",NA

Resolution","Background: Ectotherms are assumed to be strongly influenced by the surrounding ambient and environmental conditions for daily activity and movement. As such, ecological and physiological factors contribute to stimuli influencing navigation, extent of movement, and therefore habitat use. Our study focused on the intensity of activity (from acceleration data) and extent of movement (from GPS and thread trailing data) of Eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) in a fragmented landscape near their northern population limit. First, we quantified the thermal performance curve of box turtles using activity as a measure of performance. Second, we investigated ecological factors that could influence activity and movement and characterized the movement as extensive (exploration) and intensive (foraging).
Results: In contrast to previous lab work investigating effects of temperature on activity, we found no relationship between box turtle activity and temperature in the field. Furthermore, box turtle activity was consistent over a wide range of temperatures. Cluster analysis categorized movement recorded with GPS more as intensive than as extensive, while thread trailing had more movement categorized as extensive than intensive. Box turtle activity was higher during the morning hours and began to decrease as the day progressed. Based on the microclimate conditions tested, we found that box turtle movement was influenced by precipitation and time of day, and activity was most influenced by absolute humidity, ambient temperature, cloud cover, and time of day.
Conclusions: Our model ectotherm in this study, the Eastern box turtle, had activity patterns characteristic of a thermal generalist. Sampling resolution altered the characterization of movement as intensive or extensive movement, possibly altering interpretation. More information on the resolution needed to definitively identify foraging and exploratory behavior in turtles is needed. Activity and movement were nearly independent of environmental conditions, which supports the overall interpretation that turtle performance is that of a broad environmental generalist. Future studies of movement of other turtle and reptile species are needed to determine the generality of these findings.",BMC,JUL 19,2018,101186s4046201801308,"[Parlin, Adam F.; Nardone, Jessica A.; Dougherty, John Kelly; Rebein, Mimi; Schaeffer, Paul J.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA./[Safi, Kamran] Max Planck Inst Ornithol Vogelwarte Radolfzell, Obstberg 1, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.","Schaeffer, PJ (reprint author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",10_1186_s40462_018_0130_8

Radio telemetry","To understand the activity and movement patterns of Leopardus geoffroyi, we compared its behavior by radio-tracking 10 individuals in two areas of the Pampas grassland of Argentina: Campos del Tuyu Wildlife Reserve (CdT; 2F, 2 M, n = 1753 activity fixes), and Ernesto Tornquist Provincial Park (ETPP; 4F, 2 M, n = 1700 fixes), an area more strongly affected by human activities. The proportion of active fixes varied between areas and ranged from 38.4 +/- 4.4% at CdT to 42.9 +/- 8.1% at ETPP. In both areas, L geoffroyi was mainly nocturnal, with maximum activity at 1:00 h (70.9%) at CdT and 4:00 h (75.6%) at ETPP. Activity patterns were highly correlated between areas and, within each area, between sexes, possibly in relation to the nocturnal activity of its major prey. Seasonal variations were detected, with the least diurnal and nocturnal activity in spring. In both study areas, Geoffroy's cats presented variations in the amount of nocturnal activity corresponding to differences in nocturnal luminosity. However, these variations were different: cats were most active when the night was brighter at CdT, whereas at ETPP activity was lower in brighter nights. At CdT, the linear distance of movement between locations averaged 685.8 +/- 496.8 m and males moved 1.4 times farther than females. This distance was shorter at CdT than ETPP (1087.9 +/- 932.8 m), where males had movements 4.5 times greater than females. The mean speed of travel did not differ between areas (CdT: 0.44 +/- 0.45 km/h; ETPP: 0.44 +/- 0.78 km/h), but males tended to move faster than females. In the grasslands of Argentina, human disturbance did not affect the patterns of activity of L. geoffroyi but cats appeared to be forced to spend more time active and move over greater distances in the more disturbed area.

The source of this variation is the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors acting at an individual level. We documented the activity patterns of the ovoviviparous intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) over a series of tidal cycles to assess how differences in movements of individuals with different reproductive attributes (non-gravid females, gravid females and mates) might explain intra-population variability in activity. Four behaviors were measured for four consecutive tidal cycles for each of 3 months: the magnitude, frequency, and orientation of movements, and the use of shelters (i.e., crevices). In addition, we correlated movements with variations in several environmental factors (temperature, wind, humidity) during low tide to investigate the possible risk sensitivity of the different reproductive groups. All groups were more active and moved greater distances during high tide. Females, especially gravid females, appeared to be more risk-sensitive as they moved shorter distances and used shelters more often. Gravid females were also the only group with a negative relationship between air temperature and movement during low tide. We interpret these behaviors as a means to increase the probability of survival of the brooded offspring carried by the female. Males were the only group to consistently have directionality in their movements and showed evidence of an ""up-down"" behavior for remaining in a restricted zone. Reproductive attributes appear to be able to explain part of the intra-population variability in foraging activity in natural populations and should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of behavioral and ecological studies.

spatio-temporal variation","Understanding cohesion among individuals within a group is necessary to reveal the social system of group-living primates. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) are female-philopatric primates that reside in social groups. We investigated whether individual activity and social factors can affect spatio-temporal cohesion in wild female Japanese macaques. We conducted behavioral observation on a group, which contained 38 individuals and ranged over ca. 60ha during the study period. Two observers carried out simultaneous focal-animal sampling of adult female pairs during full-day follows using global positioning system which enabled us to quantify interindividual distances (IIDs), group members within visual range (i.e., visual unit), and separation duration beyond visual range as indicators of cohesion among individuals. We found considerable variation in spatio-temporal group cohesion. The overall mean IID was 99.9m (range=0-618.2m). The percentage of IIDs within visual range was 23.1%, within auditory range was 59.8%, and beyond auditory range was 17.1%. IIDs varied with activity; they were shorter during grooming and resting, and longer during foraging and traveling. Low-ranking females showed less cohesion than high-ranking ones. Kin females stayed nearly always within audible range. The macaques were weakly cohesive with small mean visual unit size (3.15 counting only adults, 5.99 counting all individuals). Both-sex units were the most frequently observed visual unit type when they were grooming/resting. Conversely, female units were the most frequently observed visual unit type when they were foraging. The overall mean visual separation duration was 25.7min (range=3-513min). Separation duration was associated with dominance rank. These results suggest that Japanese macaques regulate cohesion among individuals depending on their activity and on social relationships; they were separated to adapt food distribution and aggregated to maintain social interactions.

However, its scientific knowledge is still under development and currently on debate, particularly in relation to its behavioural ecology and social organization. Based on the previous hypothesis of individual desmans being solitary and territorial, activity and space patterns were considered to be arranged to avoid conspecifics. However, recent insights into the species' social behaviour revealed non-interspecific avoidance. With this study, we provide novel insights into the activity and space patterns of the desman, and their relation to its social behaviour. A total of 30 individuals were trapped, 18 of which provided informative radiotracking data to study (1) activity behaviour, (2) the proportion of the home range utilized and the distances travelled, and (3) the dominant movement directionality. Activity and space use patterns were affected by daylight and seasonality, but not by sex, age or number of other conspecifics sharing the home range. In contrast to the previous observations, individuals did not show a pattern of directionality in their movements. Noticeably, we observed encounters between individuals without evidence of aggressive behaviour. Our results suggest that desmans do not alter their activity or their spatial behaviour to avoid encounters with conspecifics, as previously suggested. These novel findings provide more evidence of a social structure and organization with social interactions and non-aggressive behaviour. This is of relevance for management actions and for the conservation of this endemic mammal.",SPRINGER,OCT,2014,101007s1034401408388,"[Melero, Y.; Aymerich, P.; Santulli, G.; Gosalbez, J.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Anim Biol Vertebrates, Barcelona, Spain./[Melero, Y.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.","Melero, Y (reprint author), Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",10_1007_s10344_014_0838_8

This study describes the ecological and behavioral patterns of two social groups of S. sciureus in forests adjacent to the Tucurui hydroelectric reservoir in eastern Amazonia, including range size, activity budgets, and composition of the diet. The groups were monitored at Base 4 (group B4) and Germoplasma Island (group GI). Quantitative behavioral data were collected using instantaneous scan sampling to record behavior, substrate use, and height. Home ranges were delimited using a GPS to determine group position after each 50 m of movement. Home ranges were 75.0 ha for group B4 (39 members) and 77.5 ha for group GI (32 members). The use of vertical strata was well defined, with a marked preference for the middle and lower levels of the canopy. The activity budgets of both groups were typical of those of other squirrel monkeys and were dominated by foraging (B4 = 48.7 %; GI = 49.6 %), moving (both groups 28.9 %), and feeding (B4 = 14.6 %; GI = 12.4 %). Resting was rare (B4 = 3.5 %; GI = 2.6 %) and less common than social behavior (B4 = 4.3 %; GI = 6.4 %). The diet of both groups was dominated by plant material (B4 = 70.7 % of feeding records; GI = 71.4 %), which is in contrast with the more insectivorous diets recorded for Saimiri at other sites. Group GI spent more time foraging during the dry season, whereas group B4 spent more time in the rainy season when the consumption of fruit increased (significantly, in the case of group GI). The less insectivorous diet of these groups may be due to a number of factors, including the unique habitat configuration at the site and reduced hydrological stress due to the proximity of the reservoir.",SPRINGER JAPAN KK,JUL,2013,101007s1032901303519,"[Pinheiro, Tatyana; Lopes, Maria Aparecida] Fed Univ Para, Inst Biol Sci, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil./[Ferrari, Stephen F.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil.","Pinheiro, T (reprint author), Fed Univ Para, Inst Biol Sci, BR-66059 Belem, Para, Brazil.",10_1007_s10329_013_0351_9

He spent more time engaged in moving, playing and grooming, traveled longer and entered the sleeping tree later in the dry season when fruit was abundant but did the opposite in wet season. On the other hand, another male gibbon whose family had a new-born baby did not show a similar seasonal behavioural change between the dry season (May-June) and wet season (December). Fruit availability and gibbon family composition, especially whether the family had a new-born baby, may have an influence on the activity budget, movement and sleeping time of East Bornean grey gibbons. Early night-tree entry may be influenced by combined factors such as fruit availability, predator avoidance and fruit competition with other animals. The female gibbon's activities occurred at greater height above the ground compared to that of males in the early morning and the late afternoon. Similar to other gibbons, the female East Bornean grey gibbon led the group more often than the male.

Conversion of forest to oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis) is a particular problem, so it is important to understand whether and how primates use such plantations. Populations of southern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) are declining in Peninsular Malaysia due, in large part, to conversion of primary forests to oil palm plantations. Researchers have observed macaques foraging in plantations but little information is available about how macaques cope with the expansion of plantations into their habitat. We collected GPS data on the home range of a group of wild pig-tailed macaques that foraged in both habitat types in May 2013-May 2015, and compared their use of oil palm plantation and primary rainforest by recording their activity budgets and analyzing their habitat use and diet in both habitat types 4-6 days per week in October 2014-December 2015. The group visited the plantations daily. In 2013-2014, 17% of the group's overall home range core area (0.6 km(2)) was in oil palm plantations and in 2014-2015, this increased to 28%. However, the macaques spent most of the day time in the forest and always used a sleeping tree in the forest. Macaque activity budgets in the plantation were significantly different from those in the forest. Feeding and foraging comprised a significantly larger proportion of their activity budget in the plantation, while locomotion, resting, and social behaviors occurred significantly more often in the forest. In both habitats, macaques spent most of their time on the ground and foraged primarily on the ground in the plantation. Of food items eaten in the plantation 85% were oil palm parts, including attached and fallen oil palm fruits and seeds, and flowers. Oil palm plantations serve as additional foraging ground for these macaques, but our results also show that the forest is essential, providing a greater dietary diversity and sleeping sites and allowing resting and social activities. It is not clear to what degree pig-tailed macaque populations can adapt to human-altered environments in the long term. Although our study group used oil palm plantations as regular foraging and feeding ground, pig-tailed macaques are also closely associated with the rainforest habitat, and the protection of natural forest is essential for their conservation.",SPRINGER,APR,2018,101007s107640180032z,"[Ruppert, Nadine; Holzner, Anna; See, Khai Wei; Gisbrecht, Anna; Beck, Angelika] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Biol Sci, Minden 11800, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia./[Gisbrecht, Anna] Humboldt Univ, Dept Biol, D-10099 Berlin, Germany./[Beck, Angelika] Julius Maximilians Univ Wurzburg, Bioctr, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.","Ruppert, N (reprint author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Biol Sci, Minden 11800, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.",10_1007_s10764_018_0032_z

Although hunting behaviors can improve with age and experience, many precocial.species are necessarily effective predators from birth. Additionally, many predators experience innate ontogenetic shifts in predatory strategies as they grow, allowing them to adapt to prey more appropriate for their increased size and energetic needs. Understanding how the relative roles of innate age-specific adaptation and learning have evolved requires information on how predation behavior develops in situ, in free-ranging predators. However, most of the research on the ontogeny of predation behavior is based on laboratory studies of captive animals, largely due to the difficulty of following newborn individuals in nature. Here, we take advantage of the unique tracks left by juveniles of a precocial viperid, the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes), which we used to follow free-ranging snakes in the field. We recorded details of their ambush hunting behavior, and compared the behaviors of these juveniles to adult snakes that we monitored in the field via radio telemetry. Although juvenile and adult behaviors were similar in most respects, we did find that adults chose more effective ambush sites, which may be due to their increased experience. We also found that juveniles (but typically not adults) perform periodic tail undulations while in ambush, and that juveniles displayed slightly different activity cycles. Both of these latter differences are likely the result of age-specific adaptations for juveniles' greater reliance on lizards versus small mammals as prey. We also compared the general predatory behavior of sidewinders to that of other species in the genus Crotalus. These findings will provide important baseline field information for more detailed empirical research on the ontogeny of predation behavior in precocial vertebrates. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

3 Most of the variation observed in activity levels, movement behaviour and use of area was explained at the level of individuals. The few patterns observed seemed related to reproductive biology: young individuals and adult females were active all year round, while large males were active almost exclusively during the mating season.

Facing extreme environmental conditions the activity rhythm of animals may change. The activity patterns of Geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi) were studied during a period of prey scarcity in a scrubland area of central Argentina, based on five individuals radio-collared and monitored by radio-telemetry. Activity readings were recorded every 15 min during 6- to 24-h observation periods, and a total of 3121 fixes totaling 780.3 h of monitoring were gathered for these cats. Geoffroy's cats were significantly more active during daytime (58.1 +/- 9.4% of active fixes) than during the night (33.6 +/- 2.9%). Although they were active at any time of the day, an activity peak was recorded from 12.00 to 17.00 h. This pattern is opposite to those observed in other areas or even to that recorded for this species in the same area during a period of higher prey abundance. This apparent shift toward diurnal activity could be a response to a combination of ecological (prey availability, predators or competition avoidance) and physiological (energy saving) factors. Geoffroy's cats are behaviorally flexible, but this ability may not be enough to maintain survival (and population size) under harsh environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of this management on individual snakes is not known. Differences between translocated and non-translocated snakes in terms of their activity patterns and habitat use are likely to indicate an impact on individual snakes from this procedure. We investigated these issues in a suburban parkland close to Melbourne for one of the most familiar of these snakes, the tiger snake ( Notechis scutatus). This parkland is frequently used by licenced snake controllers to release snakes that have been removed from nearby private properties at the owner's request. We used two techniques to assess activity patterns and habitat preferences of resident and translocated snakes: direct observations of tiger snakes that were resident in the park, and radiotelemetry to compare a subset of resident snakes with translocated conspecifics. The size of our transmitters dictated that we only use telemetry for large snakes (>= 750 mm snout-vent length), even though the resident population consisted mainly of intermediate-sized females (560-760 mm snout-vent length). Non-telemetred resident snakes were readily observed during spring, but rarely observed in summer and early autumn. Translocated snakes travelled greater distances than resident telemetred snakes, although there was no difference in the frequency of movements. For both groups the degree of cloud cover and maximum daily temperature had a significant influence on daily activity, with snakes being more likely to be active on relatively cool, sunny days. Relative humidity, wind speed and rainfall did not exert a significant influence on activity. Snakes exhibited bimodal peaks in daily activity, avoiding the hottest part of the day. Both resident and translocated snakes showed a preference for grassy woodlands associated with hills, but avoided escarpment woodlands and open plains. Floodplain riparian woodland was avoided by resident snakes, but used in proportion to its availability by translocated snakes. Because translocated snakes released at the study site moved larger distances and showed different habitat preferences to resident snakes we conclude that this practice influences individual snakes. Until the implications of translocation for both snakes and humans are fully understood, we recommend caution in the use of this management practice.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2005,101071WR04027,"Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia./La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia.","Clemann, N (reprint author), Arthur Rylah Inst Environm Res, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, POB 137, Heidelberg, Vic 3084, Australia.",NA

We used radiotelemetry to examine the spatial ecology and behavior of the fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), a highly venomous pit viper that is ubiquitous throughout much of Central America. Sixteen adult snakes were tracked over 2 yr in lowland rainforest of Costa Rica to determine home range, movement patterns, and foraging behavior. Consistent with previous descriptions, B. asper was found to be a highly nocturnal ambush predator, exhibiting virtually no activity during the day. Overall home range was determined using both minimum convex polygon (mean size = 5.95 ha) and 95 and 50 percent kernel density (mean size = 3.71 and 0.370 ha, respectively); home range size did not differ between males and females by any estimation method. Movement pattern was largely aseasonal and unrelated to any observed environmental conditions other than the daily low temperature. Most movements consisted of short (< 10 m) movements between daytime shelter and nocturnal ambush sites within a given area, interspersed with longer distance (> 50 m) movements to new foraging areas. Compositional analysis of habitat usage indicated an avoidance of developed areas and selection of swamp habitat. Most snakes had several activity cores (50% kernel density), the majority which were in or near swamps. These patterns suggest that space and habitat usage of fer-de-lance may be related to foraging strategy.","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MAR,2009,101111j17447429200800464x,"[Wasko, Dennis K.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Cox Sci Ctr, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA./[Sasa, Mahmood] Univ Costa Rica, Inst Clodomiro Picado, San Jose, Costa Rica.","Wasko, DK (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Cox Sci Ctr, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",NA

During November 1998-November 2000, we monitored the activity (active vs. inactive) of bears within a national park in the tropics of central Taiwan. On the basis of 4630 readings from motion-sensitive transmitters obtained in 24-h monitoring sessions, bears were active 54-57% of the time over the course of the year. However, bears were more active during summer (60 +/- 15% SD) and fall (60 +/- 15%) than in spring (47 +/- 13%). They were active mainly during daylight hours in spring and summer, and also during fall when acorns, a principal fall food, were scarce. However, extensive nocturnal activity occurred in fall when acorns were abundant. Increased nocturnal activity in fall is consistent with studies of the related American black bear Ursus americanus, and suggests that this behavior is not necessarily driven by preparation for winter denning or because of disturbance by hunters (as posited in previous studies), as bears in our study did not den (except parturient females) and were not hunted or otherwise disturbed by people.",WILEY,FEB,2007,101111j14697998200600203x,"Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Wildlife Conservat, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan./Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Grand Rapids, MI USA.","Hwang, MH (reprint author), Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Wildlife Conservat, 1 Hsech Fu Rd, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.",NA

Although black bears exhibit substantial variation in activity across the year, relatively little is known about how daily activity patterns and associated movement rates differ among sex and age classes across seasons. We used fine-scale movement data from black bears fitted with GPS collars to evaluate movement and activity patterns across sex and age classes for daily and seasonal time periods in relation to mating and foraging behavior. Black bears were most active during crepuscular time periods, moderately active during the day, and least active at night, which is consistent with previous research on black bear activity patterns in areas where bears were not greatly influenced by human activities. However, during spring and early summer, adult males moved significantly more during the crepuscular time period than they did during late summer and fall. Female and subadult males exhibited very similar activity patterns between seasons; and during late summer and fall, all bear classes exhibited similar activity patterns across daily time periods. Differences in activity patterns of males between seasons were potentially related to extensive movements undertaken during the mating season. Although adult males exhibited lower movement rates in late summer and fall compared to spring and early summer, females and subadult males did not appear to reduce movement rates during the late-summer berry season. Our research reveals that, although bear classes exhibit similar temporal patterns of daily activity and inactivity, the magnitude of movement rates revealed differences in activity patterns among bear classes, which allowed us to better understand factors influencing activity in animal populations.",BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,NOV,2011,1033980640710306,"[Lewis, Jesse S.; Rachlow, Janet L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.","Lewis, JS (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",NA

Data were obtained from 27 adult koalas over two 7-d periods during the breeding season: 12 in the early-breeding season in November 2010, and 15 in the late-breeding season in January 2011. Multiple 15 minute observation blocks on each animal were used for validation of activity patterns determined from the accelerometer data loggers. Accelerometry was effective in distinguishing between inactive (sleeping, resting) and active (grooming, feeding and moving) behaviors. Koalas were more active during the early-breeding season with a higher index of movement (overall dynamic body acceleration [ODBA]) for both males and females. Koalas showed a distinct temporal pattern of behavior, with most activity occurring from mid-afternoon to early morning.

Beckel, M",ZOO BIOL,CANIS-LUPUS,radio telemetry; behavior; Canis lupus,"Free-ranging gray wolves (Canis lupus) generally inhabit large home ranges, yet they are housed in a variety of restricted spaces when in captivity. There is continual debate as to whether space restrictions alter a wolf's behavior. The purpose of these studies was to remotely measure and then compare the amount and frequency of activity of gray wolves housed in small, artificial enclosures vs. large, more natural enclosures. Test animals comprised three adult wolves housed in kennels and three and four wolves housed in separate natural enclosures. Kenneled wolves had 2.8 m(2) of surface area per wolf, and wolves in natural enclosures had 466.6 m(2) (South Pack) and 349.9 m(2) (North Pack) per wolf. Wolves were fitted with radiotelemetry collars containing activity sensors. Activity data were recorded every 20 min for 57 continuous hr. The amount of activity for each wolf was calculated using areas under the curve (AUCs), and the frequency of activity was analyzed by spectral analysis. There was no difference (P greater than or equal to 0.22) in AUCs between kenneled wolves (1.399 +/- 0.214 x 10(5) radians) and South Pack wolves (1.564 +/- 0.139 x 10(5) radians) or North Pack wolves (1.617 +/- 0.192 x 10(5) radians). All three groups had similar peak spectral values at frequencies that were close to daily cycles (i.e., omega = 0.12-0.17 cycles per unit time). Peaks in coherence near the dominant spectral frequency were most significant between the natural enclosures and the least significant between the kenneled wolves and the South Pack wolves. Based on these criteria of activity and under these circumstances, enclosure size appeared to have no effect on wolf activity. However, small sample sizes and variation in the data do not make these results definitive.

To address this deficiency we deployed a time-lapse camera system at an abyssal site in the eastern North Pacific (Sta. M; 34 degrees 50'N, 123 degrees 00'W; 4100 m depth) to monitor epibenthic megafaunal movements over the 17-month period from February 1990 through July 1991. Photographs, each covering approximately 20 m(2), were taken every hour during this time span, except for the period from late October 1990 through mid-February 1991, when photos were taken every 4 h. Movements of the seven numerically dominant species of mobile epibenthic megafauna were digitized and analyzed for spatial patterns and temporal variation. These movements were markedly non-random for all seven species, with movement patterns falling into three broad categories: run-and-mill, loop and run. The holothuroid Peniagone vitrea displayed looping behavior that in some cases (n = 8) had a distinct, semi-diurnal component possibly attributable to the influence of external factors such as tidal currents. P. vitrea was also the only species of the seven observed to swim. Temporal variations in movement patterns were also observed, with individuals of the two most abundant species, Elpidia minutissima and P. vitrea, spending less time within the camera's field of view during periods when potential food items, in the form of pelagically-derived detrital aggregates, were visible on the sea floor compared to periods when aggregates were absent. Based on abundances, body sizes and movement patterns, the three most abundant species, E. minutissima, P. vitrea and Abyssocucumis abyssorum, traversed 76.5% of the total area of sea floor covered by all seven species between February 1990 and July 1991. Of the seven-species we studied, only two, A. abyssorum and Echinocrepis sp., left distinct traces on the sea floor. These two species accounted for only 32.8% of the total area of sea floor traversed by the mobile megafaunal community at Sta. M. Collectively, the seven numerically dominant species of mobile epibenthic megafauna at Sla. M traversed ca 36 m(2) of sea floor per year within the field of view of our time-lapse camera system (ca 20 m(2)). Our results indicate that mobile epibenthic megafauna have the potential to substantially impact benthic processes al Sta. M, particularly processes involving the utilization, processing and redistribution of particulate organic material at the sea floor.

Continuously collected activity data were paired with meteorological data collected from the site to determine factors influencing turtle behavior. Temperature, relative humidity, rain, year, month, time of day, and reproductive status affected activity levels. Increased activity levels corresponded with rain events, and males were generally more active than females, especially during spring and late summer. Overall, turtles were less active during an uncharacteristically warm and dry year compared to a year with conditions that were closer to the long-term average. Bimodal daily activity patterns have been reported in more southerly populations, and we found similar patterns near the species' northern range limit, indicating that thermal constraints may limit activity of this species across its range. Activity comparisons between a year with normal meteorological conditions and an abnormally warm and dry year provide insight to the effect that further onset of climate change may have on the activity of Ornate Box Turtles.",NA,OCT,2015,101643CH15249,NA,NA,NA

We examined the daily activity rhythm of the two species and how this varied seasonally through the study period, and investigated the association in activity patterns between the two species. Wolf activity peaked at dawn. The distance moved per time unit and the linearity of the movement were higher in wolves than in moose, but both species showed a decrease in these variables in June, coinciding with the denning and calving seasons. With the exception of the summer months when the activity of wolves and moose was limited by the raising of offspring, we found no correlation between the temporal activities of the two species. Hence, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the wolves and moose in Scandinavia have adjusted to each other's activity patterns. We discuss the results in light of the relative density of the two species and the intensive human harvest of moose, and hypothesize that synchronicity of predator-prey activity patterns may be ratio dependent.

Activity patterns of the elusive and endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are not well understood. Using GPS collars equipped with dual-axis accelerometers on captive and wild giant pandas for the first time, we investigated the impact of day, season, and weather on wild panda activity in Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China. Most pandas were not crepuscular as previously reported but had 3 apparent activity peaks, in the morning, afternoon, and around midnight. We found a peak in panda activity in June, then an apparent decrease in August and September, followed by an increase again from November to March of the following year. Activity patterns roughly corresponded to mean daily movement distances across seasons and movement behavior in a GPS-collared captive panda (studied to establish a baseline for interpreting collar-recorded activity of wild pandas). There was greater activity in times of higher solar radiation throughout every season, especially under cold conditions. This result suggests the potential for climate change to impact panda behavior in ways not previously reported. Our analysis also suggests that pandas may be constrained by tight energy budgets from their low-nutrient diet and may adjust their energy budgets by modifying their activity time and level across seasons. Our study has implications for understanding animal activity patterns across species, particularly relationships among forage, weather, and energy expenditure over time.",NA,DEC,2015,101093jmammalgyv118,NA,NA,NA

We examined traffic-related mortality of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK, and the extent to which roads affected fox activity by comparing real and randomly generated patterns of movement. There were significant seasonal differences in the number of traffic-related fox deaths for different age and sex classes; peaks were associated with periods when individuals were likely to be moving through unfamiliar terrain and would have had to cross major roads. Mortality rates per unit road length increased with road magnitude. The number of roads crossed by foxes and the rate at which roads were crossed per hour of activity increased after midnight when traffic flow was lower. Adults and juveniles crossed 17% and 30% fewer roads, respectively, than expected from randomly generated movement.

We present behavioural data from individual lobsters (n = 10) within 2 of the reserves. These data were obtained from data storage tags which logged in situ temperature and depth of specific individuals for up to 1 yr. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first direct measurements of depth obtained from freely behaving lobsters. Net movement exhibited by recaptured lobsters, measured as the distance between global positioning system positions recorded at the site of capture and recapture ranged from 15 to 580 m. Lobsters used habitats within a depth range of 1 to 57 m, and experienced sea temperatures ranging from 2 degrees C during late winter (February to March) to 18 degrees C during late summer (August to September). Lobster activity levels declined from September, reaching a minimum during February and March. From April, activity levels resumed. Seasonal variation in activity was correlated to water temperature (r(2) = 0.55). Lobsters were more active during nighttime than during daytime, and there was a tendency for lobsters to reside in more shallow water during nighttime versus daytime.

However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27 radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from 'isolated' (greater than or equal to 200 m from the group) males with data from 'within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found isolated only 11% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation, but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by eagles) than nondispersing males.

A total of 18 fish was equipped with acoustic transmitters inserted in the body cavity, 13 were tracked in the Bay of Calvi (275 mm +/- 26.9 L-F), and 5 in Achiarina Bay (260 mm +/- 33.6 LF). Two different systems were used to track the fish. The one used in the Bay of Calvi was a manual receiver and a directional hydrophone. The second system, used in Achiarina Bay, was a radioacoustic-positioning (RAP) system that continuously monitored the movements of the fish. Fish positions were put in a geographic information system (GIS) with information on the substratum and depth. Two patterns of behaviour could be identified in the three years. Either the fish had clearly defined daytime as opposed to night-time areas of residency, characterized by different depths and substrata or the fish persistently occupied the same sites during both day and night.

Using biologging, we measured locomotor activity and microclimate selection, over eight months, in five Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) living free in a Saudi Arabian desert. The oryx displayed seasonal flexibility in activity patterns, shifting from a continuous 24-h activity pattern with crepuscular peaks in cooler months to a predominantly nocturnal activity pattern during the hottest months, without reducing the total 24-h activity level. The proportion of total 24-h activity that occurred during daylight hours was just 29 8% during the hottest months, versus 53 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD, n = 5 oryx) in the other months. The attenuation in diurnal activity levels during the hot months was accompanied by the selection of cooler microclimates, presumably via shade seeking, during the heat of the day. Analysis of miniature black globe (miniglobe) temperature from a remote sensor on the collar of two female animals revealed that oryx selected microclimates cooler than the microclimates in direct sun at higher environmental heat loads across all periods, but with enhanced efficiency during the dry periods. We have quantified activity re-assignment and microclimate selection as responses to hot arid conditions in a free-living artiodactyl. Such flexible behavioural processes may act to buffer the adverse effects of the progressively hotter and drier conditions predicted to occur with climate change. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Twenty months of radio-tracking data for six individuals are presented. Badgers showed crepuscular or nocturnal activity, generally starting after sunset and ending before sunrise, being active on average for 8.26 hours per day. There was some seasonal variation in these parameters, but there was no evidence of any effect due to sex or moonlight. Nevertheless, wind speed seems to be associated with wide-ranging movements. No significant correlation was found between the onset of activity and sunset or between cessation of activity and sunrise. On average, badgers travelled 4378 in per night. Males usually had more extensive movements than did females, probably because maternal behaviour restricted female ranging. The mean distance between setts used on consecutive days was 295 in, and differed seasonally, being greater in spring 2000/2001 and summer 2000. Badgers inhabiting the cork oak woodland of our study area revealed lower sett fidelity than reported for their northern counterparts, especially those of lowland England. Only on 36% of occasions did they come back to sleep in the same sett, with females returning more often to the same den.

Telemetry","Background: Central place foragers (CPF) rest within a central place, and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur 'travelling' costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate 'activity seascapes', which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll.
Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature.
Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.",BMC,JUN 21,2018,101186s4046201801273,"[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL USA./[Watanabe, Yuuki Y.] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan./[Watanabe, Yuuki Y.] SOKENDAI Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Polar Sci, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan./[Demsar, Urska] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Scotland./[Leos-Barajas, Vianey] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA USA./[Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA./[Langrock, Roland] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Bielefeld, Germany./[Weng, Kevin] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Dept Fisheries Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA./[Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA./[Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA./[Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA./[Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","Demsar, U (reprint author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Scotland.",10_1186_s40462_018_0127_3

Voss, Kelley M.",NA,NA,NA,"The spatial movement and ecology of highly mobile marine predators can strongly influence, and be influenced by, a variety of ecological factors. Octopuses are voracious predators, and their predatory behavior can have significant impacts on the abundance and diversity of their prey communities. Nine Octopus bimaculatus (Verrill, 1883) were tagged and tracked during August 2014 using active tracking techniques. Octopus GPS position was recorded daily over the course of 12.9 +/- 5.6 days (mean +/- SD) and continuous movement was tracked for 20.8 +/- 5.0 h (mean SD) for each animal. O. bimaculatus occupied an activity space of approximately 6000 +/- 3000 km(2) (mean +/- SD). Larger animals moved over larger areas, but activity space size was not correlated with octopus sex, habitat location, or time of day. Movement distances and diurnal movement patterns were highly variable for this species, both within and between individual octopuses. O. bimaculatus were highly mobile compared to other octopuses of similar size tracked in a similar way. These results are contradictory to previous estimates of movement and den fidelity for this species in this area, suggesting either a previous underestimate of O. bimaculatus movement, or a change in the way this species moves through its environment. This study pioneered the application of acoustic telemetry to octopuses in Califomia ecosystems, and provides insight into the heterogeneity of octopus behavior and the potential impacts this heterogeneity may have on octopus prey and predator communities.

Much of this scarcity in knowledge can be attributed to deepwater animals being secretive or comparatively 'rare', as well as technical difficulties associated with accessing such remote habitats. Here we tested whether two species of giant marine isopod (Bathynomus giganteus, Booralana tricarinata) captured from 653 to 875 m in the Caribbean Sea near Eleuthera, The Bahamas, exhibited an activity behavioural syndrome across two environmental contexts (presence/absence of food stimulus) and further whether this syndrome carried over consistently between sexes. We also measured routine metabolic rate and oxygen consumption in response to a food stimulus in B. giganteus to assess whether these variables are related to individual differences in personality. We found that both species show an activity syndrome across environmental contexts, but the underlying mechanistic basis of this syndrome, particularly in B. giganteus, is unclear. Contrary to our initial predictions, neither B. giganteus nor B. tricarinata showed any differences between mean expression of behavioural traits between sexes. Both sexes of B. tricarinata showed strong evidence of an activity syndrome underlying movement and foraging ecology, whereas only male B. giganteus showed evidence of an activity syndrome. Generally, individuals that were more active and bolder, in a standard open arena test were also more active when a food stimulus was present. Interestingly, individual differences in metabolism were not related to individual differences in behaviour based on present data.

We studied the effectiveness of this system in producing variation in behavior, controlling stereotypies, and eliciting natural behaviors. Twelve animals representing five species of mammals (orangutans, siamangs, tapirs, babirusa, and Sumatran and Siberian tigers) were the subjects of focal observations measuring activity levels, stereotypies, natural behaviors, and space utilization. Statistical analysis was used to assess the association between variation in behavior and the movement among the four exhibits. For several animals, the persistence of behavioral changes was studied over a period of 3 years. We also examined the influence of the previous animal in the exhibit on the focal animal. Moving animals among the exhibits affected activity levels and/or space utilization in all animals in the activity-based management system. In cases for which 3-year data were available, there was evidence of habituation to the novelty of changing exhibits. Stereotypies, usually in the form of pacing, were affected by exhibits, providing the opportunity to manipulate these behavior patterns by exhibit placement. Natural behaviors in the form of urine-spraying by the female tapir and the Sumatran tiger were affected by which animal had previously been in the exhibit. The results support the conclusion that exposure to varying exhibits produces variation in the behavior of the animals and elicits natural behaviors that would be unlikely to occur in a traditional single-species exhibit. Activity-based management provides unique opportunities for the behavioral enrichment of captive animals.

How much time animals spend engaged in different activities with specific energetic costs ultimately defines their likelihood of surviving and successfully reproducing. However, it is extremely difficult to determine the energetic costs of independent activities for free-ranging animals. In this study, we developed a new method to calculate activity-specific metabolic rates, and applied it to female fur seals. We attached biologgers (that recorded GPS locations, depth profiles, and triaxial acceleration) to 12 northern (Callorhinus ursinus) and 13 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), and used a hierarchical decision tree algorithm to determine time allocation between diving, transiting, resting, and performing slow movements at the surface (grooming, etc.). We concomitantly measured the total energy expenditure using the doubly-labelled water method. We used a general least-square model to establish the relationship between time-activity budgets and the total energy spent by each individual during their foraging trip to predict activity-specific metabolic rates. Results show that both species allocated similar time to diving (similar to 29%), transiting to and from their foraging grounds (similar to 26-30%), and resting (similar to 8-11%). However, Antarctic fur seals spent significantly more time grooming and moving slowly at the surface than northern fur seals (36% vs. 29%). Diving was the most expensive activity (similar to 30 MJ/day if done non-stop for 24 hr), followed by transiting at the surface (similar to 21 MJ/day). Interestingly, metabolic rates were similar between species while on land or while slowly moving at the surface (similar to 13 MJ/day). Overall, the average field metabolic rate was similar to 20 MJ/day (for all activities combined). The method we developed to calculate activity-specific metabolic rates can be applied to terrestrial and marine species to determine the energetic costs of daily activities, as well as to predict the energetic consequences for animals forced to change their time allocations in response to environmental shifts.",NA,MAY,2017,101002ece32546,NA,NA,NA

Establishing how group living varies across species is critical for comparative studies to examine the origin and the adaptive value of this behavior. Comparative approaches are more powerful when a diverse array of taxonomic groups is included. We used telemetry techniques to monitor patterns of activity, resting places, and range areas at night to examine the extent of sociality of the scarcely known viscacha rats, Octomys mimax. Seven individuals were live trapped and fitted with radio-collars. Viscacha rat activity, as measured from distance moved between consecutive telemetry scans, took place mostly during the nighttime. During day, animals used from 2 to 6 putative nest places, but one was used more frequently. The sharing of resting locations by two or more radio-collared animals was never recorded. Viscacha rats showed relatively large range areas and low-to-moderate spatial overlap with neighbors. Mate rats had larger range areas than females, but spatial overlap with neighbors was similar. Results suggest that viscacha rats are solitary living animals. This study supported a solitary-to-social trend from basal to more derivate forms across Octodontidae. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the first annual actograms (for red-backed shrike Lanius collurio) to explore new analyses and insights that become possible with accelerometer data. Actogram data allow precise estimates of numbers of flights, flight durations as well as departure/landing times during the annual cycle. Annual and diurnal rhythms of migratory flights, as well as prolonged nocturnal flights across desert barriers are illustrated. The shifting balance between flight, rest and different intensities of activity throughout the year as revealed by actogram data can be used to analyse exertion levels during different phases of the life cycle.

Our objective was to assess effect of an ad hoc (h_ad hoc) smoothing parameter in kernel analysis from two species that were predicted to have different patterns of utilization distributions across a range of sample sizes. We evaluated variation in homerange estimates with location data collected from GPS collars on two species: mule deer Odocoileus hemionus and coyotes Canis latrans. We calculated home ranges using 95% and 50% kernel contours using reference (h_ref) and h_ad hoc smoothing parameters. To evaluate the influence of sample size, we calculated home ranges using both smoothing parameters for random subsamples of 5, 10, 25 and 50% of GPS locations and compared area estimates to estimates for 100% of GPS locations. On mule deer, we also conducted visual relocations using conventional radiotelemetry, which resulted in fewer locations than GPS collars. Area was overestimated at smaller sample sizes, but an interesting pattern was noted with higher relative bias at 60-100 locations than at sample sizes < 50 locations. Relative bias was most likely due to increased smoothing of outer data points. Subsampling allowed us to examine relative bias across a range of samples sizes for the two smoothing parameters. Minimum number of points to obtain a consistent home range estimates varied by smoothing method, species, study duration, and volume contour (95% or 50%). While h_ad hoc performed consistently better over most sample sizes, there may not be a universal recommendation for all studies and species. Behavioral traits resulting in concentrated or disparate space use complicates comparisons among and between species.

Rummer, Jodie L.",NA,NA,NA,"Previous studies hailed thermal tolerance and the capacity for organisms to acclimate and adapt as the primary pathways for species survival under climate change. Here we challenge this theory. Over the past decade, more than 365 tropical stenothermal fish species have been documented moving poleward, away from ocean warming hotspots where temperatures 2-3 degrees C above long-term annual means can compromise critical physiological processes. We examined the capacity of a model species - a thermally sensitive coral reef fish, Chromis viridis (Pomacentridae) - to use preference behaviour to regulate its body temperature. Movement could potentially circumvent the physiological stress response associated with elevated temperatures and may be a strategy relied upon before genetic adaptation can be effectuated. Individuals were maintained at one of six temperatures (23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 degrees C) for at least 6weeks. We compared the relative importance of acclimation temperature to changes in upper critical thermal limits, aerobic metabolic scope and thermal preference. While acclimation temperature positively affected the upper critical thermal limit, neither aerobic metabolic scope nor thermal preference exhibited such plasticity. Importantly, when given the choice to stay in a habitat reflecting their acclimation temperatures or relocate, fish acclimated to end-of-century predicted temperatures (i.e. 31 or 33 degrees C) preferentially sought out cooler temperatures, those equivalent to long-term summer averages in their natural habitats (similar to 29 degrees C). This was also the temperature providing the greatest aerobic metabolic scope and body condition across all treatments. Consequently, acclimation can confer plasticity in some performance traits, but may be an unreliable indicator of the ultimate survival and distribution of mobile stenothermal species under global warming. Conversely, thermal preference can arise long before, and remain long after, the harmful effects of elevated ocean temperatures take hold and may be the primary driver of the escalating poleward migration of species.",NA,FEB,2017,101111gcb13488,NA,NA,NA

Movement patterns were markedly nocturnal, with hourly step lengths averaging 33969.5 m (SE) during night and 60 +/- 4.1 m during day, and night locations were significantly closer to human settlements than day locations. However, more nocturnal movements were observed among those three living in the areas with high human population densities. These visited houses regularly at nighttime (20% of locations,25 m from houses), but rarely during day (<1%). One leopard living in a sparsely populated area avoided human settlements both day and night. The small home ranges of the leopards indicate that anthropogenic food resources may be plentiful although wild prey is absent. The study provides clear insights into the ability of leopards to live and move in landscapes that are extremely modified by human activity.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,NOV 12,2014,101371journalpone0112044,"[Odden, Morten] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Koppang, Norway./[Athreya, Vidya] Wildlife Conservat Soc India, Bangalore, Karnataka, India./[Athreya, Vidya] Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bangalore, Karnataka, India./[Rattan, Sandeep] Himachal Pradesh Forest Dept, Wildlife Wing, Shimla, Himachal Prades, India./[Linnell, John D.

Multibeam processing methods now offer improved capacities for raw data storage. The Simrad SP90 sonar was used for the detection of fish schools associated with drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs), and digital systems developed for the acquisition and processing of volume backscattering echoes and position data. Data sampling methods were defined based on two modes: one for periods searching for FADs and associated schools, and one for school monitoring in drifting mode. Validation of the detection of several FAD-associated schooling species was made by simultaneous visual observations or/and cross-checking with echosounder recordings. The characteristics of schooling behaviour in the targeted fish species are fundamental for the correct interpretation of acoustic data. Sonar detection threshold is the result of a compromise between fish number, size, species and the nearest neighbour distance (NND) of individuals per dynamic structure (school or shoal). Tuna schooling dynamics mean that NND can sometimes be too large to allow the presence of these fish to be detected, despite their number. Sonar data should be analysed and interpreted in a holistic manner, in combination with behaviour pattern and dynamics of all species around the drifting FADs. An autonomous sonar buoy prototype equipped with 360 scanning sonar coupled to video cameras will increase our understanding of tuna behaviour around drifting or anchored objects. A similar methodology can be applied to different kinds of platforms, either anchored or in permanent positions. This would improve the monitoring of fish schools around artificial reefs, open sea aquaculture farms, and across estuaries, channels or straits; applications which are undoubtedly essential for progressive fisheries management.",EDP SCIENCES S A,OCT-DEC,2007,101051alr2008016,"[Brehmer, Patrice] Univ Aegean, Co IRD UR 109, Ctr Rech Halieut Mediterraneenne & Trop, F-34203 Sete, France./[Georgakarakos, Stratis; Trygonis, Vasilis] Univ Aegean, Fisheries & Sonar Lab, Mitilini 81100, Greece./[Josse, Erwan] US004, Ctr Bretagne, Inst Rech Dev, F-29280 Plouzane, France./[Dalen, John] Inst Marine Res, N-5817 Bergen, Norway.","Brehmer, P (reprint author), Univ Aegean, Co IRD UR 109, Ctr Rech Halieut Mediterraneenne & Trop, 1 Ave Jean Monnet,BP 171, F-34203 Sete, France.",10_1051_alr_2008016

Forty-eight dairy heifers in four trials were brought in from pasture and housed individually in straw-bedded pens prior to the experiment. During the experimental period of 24 days, the heifers were either tethered in stalls with concrete floor during all 24 days, the last 10 days, the last 3 days, or stayed in the pens for the whole period (control). At the end of the experimental period, the behaviour of all heifers was video-recorded during 24 h. The number of investigations of the lying surface per lying down was largest (P < 0.001), and the latency to Lie down was longest(P < 0.001) in heifers tethered for 3 days. Heifers tethered for 3 days had fewer lying periods per 24 h (P < 0.001), and the lying down movement took the longest time in these heifers (P < 0.001). However, the number of lying interruptions per lying down was higher in heifers tethered for 3 and 10 days compared to control heifers, while heifers tethered for 24 days was in between (P < 0.001). Heifers tethered for 3 days appeared to have the greatest problems and loose heifers appeared to have fewest problems with lying down. The results suggest that heifers have problems lying down in tie-stalls, especially shortly after tethering, and that full adaptation to tethering does not occur within the time investigated.

Big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, were trained to discriminate a smooth 16 mm diameter object (S+) from a size-matched textured object (S-), both of which were tethered in random locations in a flight room. The bat's three-dimensional flight path was reconstructed using stereo images from high-speed video recordings, and the bat's sonar vocalizations were recorded for each trial and analyzed off-line. A microphone array permitted reconstruction of the sonar beam pattern, allowing us to study the bat's directional gaze and inspection of the objects. Bats learned the discrimination, but performance varied with S-. In acoustic studies of the objects, the S+ and S- stimuli were ensonified with frequency-modulated sonar pulses. Mean intensity differences between S+ and S- were within 4 dB. Performance data, combined with analyses of echo recordings, suggest that the big brown bat listens to changes in sound spectra from echo to echo to discriminate between objects. Bats adapted their sonar calls as they inspected the stimuli, and their sonar behavior resembled that of animals foraging for insects.

Acoustic target identities were validated using trawl samples and stomach analysis. The dynamics of changes in school structure were analysed in relation to stimuli impinging on the schools. School structure changed in response to approaches by other herring schools, likely predators, and the research vessel. Over 230 behavioural events, at approximately 5 min intervals, reveal a surprisingly dynamic regime of approaching, joining, and splitting that could facilitate rapid adaptive adjustment of herring school size to prevailing conditions. Moreover, our interpretation of the visualization of the schools by sonar suggests adaptive responses to different kinds of predatory attacks. Individual cod and haddock predators intimately accompanied the herring schools, their attacks causing frequent modifications to, but not dispersal of school structure, so that most herring were able to continue feeding while retaining the risk-dilution advantages of schooling. On the other hand, rapid approach by fast-moving schooling predators such as saithe, or by the research vessel, caused the herring to dive steeply. Consequent loss of feeding and reassembly was evidently a cost of evading these more dangerous predators.

After translational motion compensation, we describe the equivalent rotation of maneuvering targets by two variables-the relative chirp rate of the linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal and the Doppler focus shift. The first variable indicates the target's motion status, and the second one represents the possible residual error of the translational motion compensation. With them, a modified Fourier transform matrix is constructed and then used for cross-range compression. Consequently, the imaging of maneuvering is converted into a two-dimensional parameter optimization problem in which a stable and clear ISAR image is guaranteed. A gradient descent optimization scheme is employed to obtain the accurate relative chirp rate and Doppler focus shift. Moreover, we designed an efficient and robust initialization process for the gradient descent method, thus, the well-focused ISAR images of maneuvering targets can be achieved adaptively. Human intervention is not needed, and it is quite convenient for practical ISAR imaging systems. Compared to precedent imaging methods, the new method achieves better imaging quality under reasonable computational cost.

Though these claims have recently come into question, the proposal that many animals forage using Levy processes nonetheless remains. A Levy process does not consider when or where resources are encountered, and samples movement lengths independently of past experience. However, Levy processes too have come into question based on the observation that in patchy resource environments resource-sensitive foraging strategies, like area-restricted search, perform better than Levy flights yet can still generate heavy-tailed distributions of movement lengths. To investigate these questions further, we tracked humans as they searched for hidden resources in an open-field virtual environment, with either patchy or dispersed resource distributions. Supporting previous research, for both conditions logarithmic binning methods were consistent with Levy flights and rank-frequency methods-comparing alternative distributions using maximum likelihood methods-showed the strongest support for bounded power-law distributions (truncated Levy flights). However, goodness-of-fit tests found that even bounded power-law distributions only accurately characterized movement behavior for 4 (out of 32) participants. Moreover, paths in the patchy environment (but not the dispersed environment) showed a transition to intensive search following resource encounters, characteristic of area-restricted search. Transferring paths between environments revealed that paths generated in the patchy environment were adapted to that environment. Our results suggest that though power-law distributions do not accurately reflect human search, Levy processes may still describe movement in dispersed environments, but not in patchy environments-where search was area-restricted. Furthermore, our results indicate that search strategies cannot be inferred without knowing how organisms respond to resources-as both patched and dispersed conditions led to similar Levy-like movement distributions.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 5,2013,101371journalpone0060488,"[Hills, Thomas T.] Univ Warwick, Dept Psychol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England./[Kalff, Christopher] Univ Freiburg, Ctr Cognit Sci, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany./[Wiener, Jan M.] Bournemouth Univ, Psychol Res Ctr, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.","Hills, TT (reprint author), Univ Warwick, Dept Psychol, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",10_1371_journal_pone_0060488

Understanding the effects of landscape heterogeneity on the movements of large herbivores such as North American elk is considered very important for their management. Most simulation studies on movements of large herbivores use predetermined behavioral rules based on empirical observations, or simply on what seems reasonable for animals to do. Here we did not impose movement rules but instead we considered that animals had higher fitness (hence better performance) when they managed to avoid predators, and when they acquired important fat reserves before winter. Individual decision-making was modeled with neural networks that received as input those variables suspected to be important in determining movement efficiency. Energetic gains and losses were tracked based on known physiological characteristics of ruminants. A genetic algorithm was used to improve the overall performance of the decision processes in different landscapes and ultimately to select certain movement behaviors. We found more variability in movement patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. Emergent properties of movement paths were concentration of activities in well-defined areas and an alternation between small, localized movement with larger, exploratory movements. Even though our simulated individuals moved shorter distances that actual elk, we found similarities in several aspects of their movement patterns such as in the distributions of distance moved and turning angles, and a tendency to return to previously visited areas.",SPRINGER,APR,2005,101007s1098000500619,"Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA./Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada./Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.","Morales, JM (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, 75 N Eagleville Rd,U-43, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",10_1007_s10980_005_0061_9

While the food-web theory has traditionally been built on the former mechanism, the latter mechanism has formed the basis of a successful theory explaining the spatial distribution of organisms in the context of behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Yet, few studies have compared these two mechanisms, leaving the question of how similar (or different) predictions derived from birth-death-based and movement-based food-web theories unanswered. Here, theoretical models of the tri-trophic (resource-consumer-top predator) food chain were used to compare food-web patterns arising from these two mechanisms. Specifically, we evaluated the response of the food-chain structure to inter-patch differences in productivity for movement-based models and birth-death-based models. Model analysis reveals that adaptive movements give rise to positively correlated responses of all trophic levels to increased productivity; however, this pattern was not observed in the corresponding birth-death-based model. The movement-based model predicts that the food chain response to productivity is determined by the sensitivity of animal movement to the environmental conditions. More specifically, increasing sensitivity of a consumer or top predator leads to smaller inter-patch variance of the resource or consumer density, while increasing inter-patch variance in the consumer or resource density.

Euhadra brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b. sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals. The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably supported by food availability as well.

As insectivorous bats forage, they increase sonar call rate with decreasing prey distance, and often embedded in bat insect approach sequences are clusters of sonar sounds, termed sonar sound groups (SSGs). The bat's production of SSGs has been observed in both field and laboratory conditions, and is hypothesized to sharpen spatiotemporal sonar resolution. When insectivorous bats hunt, they may encounter erratically moving prey, which increases the demands on the bat's sonar imaging system. Here, we studied the bat's adaptive vocal behavior in an experimentally controlled insect-tracking task, allowing us to manipulate the predictability of target trajectories and measure the prevalence of SSGs. With this system, we trained bats to remain stationary on a platform and track a moving prey item, whose trajectory was programmed either to approach the bat, or to move back and forth, before arriving at the bat. We manipulated target motion predictability by varying the order in which different target trajectories were presented to the bats. During all trials, we recorded the bat's sonar calls and later analysed the incidence of SSG production during the different target tracking conditions. Our results demonstrate that bats increase the production of SSGs when target unpredictability increases, and decrease the production of SSGs when target motion predictability increases. Furthermore, bats produce the same number of sonar vocalizations irrespective of the target motion predictability, indicating that the animal's temporal clustering of sonar call sequences to produce SSGs is purposeful, and therefore involves sensorimotor planning.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,SEP,2018,101242jeb176537,"[Kothari, Ninad B.; Wohlgemuth, Melville J.; Moss, Cynthia F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Krieger Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA./[Moss, Cynthia F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Solomon H Snyder Dept Neurosci, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA./[Moss, Cynthia F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Whiting Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA./[Moss, Cynthia F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Behav Biol Program Chair, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.","Kothari, NB (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Krieger Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",NA

Raiding behaviour is considered a threat to human health and safety, may result in damage to property, and has adverse welfare and conservation impacts on baboons. To mitigate this conflict, Cape Town municipality employs field rangers with paintball markers that 'herd' baboons away from the urban edge. While this strategy is successful in reducing the time baboons spend in urban spaces, baboons still raid successfully. Here, we use direct observation and GPS data to investigate how one troop uses the peri-urban space and exploits human-derived foods in urban areas and on farmland. We contrast this behaviour with the individual management strategies adopted by field rangers which we assessed in individual interviews. We find that baboons utilize space (1) where inter-individual variation in field ranger management strategy is highest, (2) that is close to refuges in forested habitat and (3) that is close to the urban edge. Overall, this suggests adaptive space use by the baboons, whereby they minimize distances to refuges and potential food rewards, while exploiting uncertainty in risk variability that arises due to inter-individual differences in ranger management strategy.

Animals that use flight as their mode of transportation must cope with the fact that their migration and orientation performance is strongly affected by the flow of the medium they are moving in, that is by the winds. Different strategies can be used to mitigate the negative effects and benefit from the positive effects of a moving flow. The strategies an animal can use will be constrained by the relationship between the speed of the flow and the speed of the animal's own propulsion in relation to the surrounding air.
2. Here we analyse entomological and ornithological radar data from north-western Europe to investigate how two different nocturnal migrant taxa, the noctuid moth Autographa gamma and songbirds, deal with wind by analysing variation in resulting flight directions in relation to the wind-dependent angle between the animal's heading and track direction.
3. Our results, from fixed locations along the migratory journey, reveal different global strategies used by moths and songbirds during their migratory journeys. As expected, nocturnally migrating moths experienced a greater degree of wind drift than nocturnally migrating songbirds, but both groups were more affected by wind in autumn than in spring.
4. The songbirds' strategies involve elements of both drift and compensation, providing some benefits from wind in combination with destination and time control. In contrast, moths expose themselves to a significantly higher degree of drift in order to obtain strong wind assistance, surpassing the songbirds in mean ground speed, at the cost of a comparatively lower spatiotemporal migratory precision.
5. Moths and songbirds show contrasting but adaptive responses to migrating through a moving flow, which are fine-tuned to the respective flight capabilities of each group in relation to the wind currents they travel within.",NA,JAN,2016,1.01111136526561E+018,NA,NA,NA

Although the development of electronic and telecommunication equipment has led to an increased amount and refined resolution of data about individuals' spatio-temporal trajectories, the potential of such data, especially in the context of environmental health studies, has not been fully realized due to the lack of methodology that addresses location uncertainties. This article describes a methodological framework for deriving information about people's continuous activities from individual-collected Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is vital for a variety of environmental health studies. This framework is composed of two major methods that address critical issues at different stages of GPS data processing: (1) a fuzzy classification method for distinguishing activity patterns; and (2) a scale-adaptive method for refining activity locations and outdoor/indoor environments. Evaluation of this framework based on smartphone-collected GPS data indicates that it is robust to location errors and is able to generate useful information about individuals' life trajectories.",WILEY,AUG,2017,101111tgis12231,"[Wan, Neng] Univ Utah, Geog, 332 S 1400 E,RM 217, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA./[Kan, Ge Lin] Univ Nevada, Community Hlth Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.","Wan, N (reprint author), Univ Utah, Geog, 332 S 1400 E,RM 217, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",NA

However, GPS measurement error and noise limit the application of such systems. Many attempts have been made to adjust GPS measurements and eliminate their errors. Comparing common nonlinear methods used in the adjustment of GPS positioning for the monitoring of structures is the main objective of this study. Nonlinear Adaptive-Recursive Least Square (RLS), extended Kalman filter (EKF), and wavelet principal component analysis (WPCA) are presented and applied to improve the quality of GPS time series observations. Two real monitoring observation systems for the Mansoura railway and long-span Yonghe bridges are utilized to examine suitable methods used to assess bridge behavior under different load conditions. From the analysis of the results, it is concluded that the wavelet principal component is the best method to smooth low and high GPS sampling frequency observations. The evaluation of the bridges reveals the ability of the GPS systems to detect the behavior and damage of structures in both the time and frequency domains.",MDPI,DEC,2016,103390ijgi5120222,"[Kaloop, Mosbeh R.; Hu, Jong Wan] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Inchon 22012, South Korea./[Kaloop, Mosbeh R.; Hu, Jong Wan] Incheon Natl Univ, Incheon Disaster Prevent Res Ctr, Inchon 22012, South Korea./[Kaloop, Mosbeh R.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Publ Works & Civil Engn, Mansoura 35516, Egypt./[Elbeltagi, Emad] Mansoura Univ, Dept Struct Engn, Mansoura 35516, Egypt./[Elbeltagi, Emad] Mansoura Higher Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Talkha 35111, Egypt.","Hu, JW (reprint author), Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Inchon 22012, South Korea.; Hu, JW (reprint author), Incheon Natl Univ, Incheon Disaster Prevent Res Ctr, Inchon 22012, South Korea.",NA

Although crucial to individual survival, foraging strategies before moult have been little investigated in keystone marine consumers in the Southern Ocean. The Macaroni Penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus demonstrates how individuals may adjust their foraging strategies during this period in line with constraints such as potential intraspecific competition between localities, foraging ability between dimorphic sexes and timing at sea between breeding and non-breeding population components. We recorded pre-moult behaviour at sea for 22 Macaroni Penguins from Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (southern Indian Ocean) during 2009 and 2011, using light-based geolocation and stable isotope analysis. Penguins were distributed in population-specific oceanic areas with similar surface temperatures (3.5 degrees C) south of the archipelagos, where they foraged at comparable trophic levels based on stable isotopes of their blood. Bayesian broken stick' modelling with concurrent analysis of seawater temperature records from the animal-borne devices showed that within each population, females remained 6days longer than males in the colder waters before heading back towards their colonies. Finally, 17 other non-breeding individuals that moulted earlier had a higher mean blood 15N value than did post-breeding birds, meaning that early moulters probably fed more on fish than did late moulters. Our findings of such adjustments in foraging strategies developed across locality, sex and breeding status help understanding of the species' contrasted pre-moult biology across its range and its ecology in the non-breeding period.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUL,2014,101111ibi12151,"[Thiebot, Jean-Baptiste; Cherel, Yves; Acqueberge, Manon; Prudor, Aurelien; Bost, Charles-Andre] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France./[Trathan, Philip N.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.","Thiebot, JB (reprint author), Natl Inst Polar Res, 10-3 Midoricho Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan.",NA

To pass another pedestrian (an interferer) walking direction, walking speed or both can be adjusted. Currently, the literature is not yet conclusive of how humans adjust these two parameters in the presence of an interferer. This impedes the development of models predicting general obstacle avoidance strategies in humans' walking behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the adjustments of path and speed when a pedestrian is crossing a non-reactive human interferer at different angles and speeds, and to compare the results to general model predictions. To do so, we designed an experiment where a pedestrian walked a 12 m distance to reach a goal position. The task was designed in such a way that collision with an interferer would always occur if the pedestrian would not apply a correction of movement path or speed. Results revealed a strong dependence of path and speed adjustments on crossing angle and walking speed, suggesting local planning of the collision avoidance strategy. Crossing at acute angles (i.e. 45 degrees and 90 degrees) seems to require more complex collision avoidance strategies involving both path and speed adjustments than crossing at obtuse angles, where only path adjustments were observed. Overall, the results were incompatible with predictions from existing models of locomotor collision avoidance. The observed initiations of both adjustments suggest a collision avoidance strategy that is temporally controlled. The present study provides a comprehensive picture of human collision avoidance strategies in walking, which can be used to evaluate and adjust existing pedestrian dynamics models, or serve as an empirical basis to develop new models.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,FEB 26,2014,101371journalpone0089589,"[Huber, Markus; Glasauer, Stefan] Univ Munich, Ctr Sensorimotor Res, Inst Clin Neurosci, Munich, Germany./[Su, Yi-Huang; Krueger, Melanie; Faschian, Katrin; Hermsdoerfer, Joachim] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Movement Sci, D-80290 Munich, Germany./[Krueger, Melanie] Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Neurosci Brain & Mind, Munich, Germany./[Glasauer, Stefan] Univ Munich, German Ctr Vertigo & Balance Disorders, Munich, Germany./[Glasauer, Stefan] Bernstein Ctr Computat Neurosci Munich, Munich, Germany.","Glasauer, S (reprint author), Univ Munich, Ctr Sensorimotor Res, Inst Clin Neurosci, Munich, Germany.",10_1371_journal_pone_0089589

Lift and drag, the two major properties in aerodynamics, are highly dependent on air density. With decreasing air density drag is reduced and lift per wingbeat decreases. According to flight mechanical theory, wingbeat frequency and air speed should increase with decreasing air density, i.e. increasing flight altitude. Although wind tunnel experiments have shed light on many aspects of avian flight, the effect of air density remained ambiguous, because air density could not be adjusted in wind tunnels, until now. By means of radar we recorded tracks of several thousand free-flying individual birds during nocturnal migration. From these tracks we derived wingbeat frequencies and air speeds covering air densities from 0.84 kg m(-3) to 1.13 kg m(-3), corresponding to an altitudinal range of about 3000 m. We demonstrate here with this sample of nocturnal migrants that: (1) wingbeat frequency decreases with air density (which corresponds to an increase in flap-gliding flyers by 0.4 Hz km(-1) and in bounding flyers by 1.1 Hz km(-1)), (2) reducing wingbeat frequency to equivalent sea level values did not abolish the dependency on air density, as expected by flight mechanical theory, and (3) bounding flyers show a higher response in their flight behavioural adjustments to changes in air density than flap-gliding flyers. With respect to air speed flap-gliding flyers increase their air speed by 1.0 m s(-1)km(-1) and bounding flyers by 1.4 m s(-1)km(-1).",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,NOV 15,2009,101242jeb031435,"[Schmaljohann, H.; Liechti, F.] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland./[Schmaljohann, H.] Inst Avian Res Vogelwarte Helgoland, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany.","Schmaljohann, H (reprint author), Swiss Ornithol Inst, Luzernerstr 6, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland.",NA

Despite conservation and rehabilitation plans, populations of this species are dramatically declining due to human impacts such as habitat fragmentation, overfishing and water pollution. Owing to their large body size, anadromous adults were historically invulnerable to fish predation during their spawning period migration. This invulnerability has disappeared in Western Europe with the introduction of a new freshwater predator, the European catfish (Silurus glanis). Here we report how adults of Atlantic salmon are predated in the fishway of a large river of SW France, where the delayed and narrow passage created by the structure increases the probability of predator-prey encounter. We assessed predation risk by monitoring salmon and catfish in one fishway of the River Garonne, using video fish-counting from 1993 to 2016. We analysed the predation strategy of catfish using observations made with acoustic camera and RFID telemetry in 2016. Our results demonstrate a high predation rate (35% - 14/39 ind.) on salmon inside the fishway during the 2016 spawning period migration. Our results suggest that a few specialized catfish individuals adapted their hunting behaviour to such prey, including their presence synchronized with that of salmon (i.e, more occurrences by the end of the day). Such results suggest that the spread of European catfish will potentially impact migration of anadromous species through anthropized systems.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 19,2018,101371journalpone0196046,"[Bouletreau, Stephanie; Gaillagot, Adeline; Santoul, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, EcoLab, Toulouse, France./[Carry, Laurent] MIGADO, St Orens De Gameville, France./[Tetard, Stephane; De Oliveira, Eric] EDF R&D, LNHE, Chatou, France.","Santoul, F (reprint author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, EcoLab, Toulouse, France.",10_1371_journal_pone_0196046

Previous studies have investigated the benefits of food calling during the nestling phase, however, there is a current paucity of data on the use of food calls after young have fledged. This study describes the use of 'purr' calls, given by adult pied babblers, Turdoides bicolor, when feeding both nestlings and fledglings. Offspring associated these calls with food delivery: nestlings begged in response to experimental playbacks of purr calls; whereas fledglings, which were no longer confined to the nest, approached calling adults. As well as with feeds, adults also gave purr calls in nonfeeding contexts. Playbacks of purr calls given in feeding and nonfeeding contexts elicited the same responses, suggesting that offspring expected food when they responded to both 'feed' and 'no-feed' purr calls. Adults seemed to use the association between purr calls and food delivery by giving no-feed purr calls to promote fledgling movement, for example when leading young away from predators. Fledglings directly benefited when they approached adults who gave no-feed purr calls, despite not receiving any food. This study raises the possibility that food calling during the fledgling phase is a widespread, but understudied form of parent-offspring communication in birds and may be a more important aspect of avian parental care than is currently realized.

Recent advances in tracking host behaviour (bio-logging: e.g., GPS tracking, barcoding) and tracking pathogens (high-resolution sequencing), as well as methodological advances (multi-layer networks, computational techniques) started producing exciting new insights into disease transmission through contact networks. We discuss some of the exciting directions that the field is taking, some of the challenges, and importantly the opportunities that lie ahead. For instance, we suggest to integrate multiple transmission pathways, multiple pathogens, and in some systems, multiple host species, into the next generation of network models. Corresponding opportunities exist in utilising molecular techniques, such as high-resolution sequencing, to establish causality in network connectivity and disease outcomes. Such novel developments and the continued integration of network tools offers a more complete understanding of pathogen transmission processes, their underlying mechanisms and their evolutionary consequences.",BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,JAN,2018,1011631568539X00003507,"[Leu, Stephan T.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia./[Godfrey, Stephanie S.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand.","Leu, ST (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",NA

The goals of this study were to review previous studies that deployed single-pin transmitters and determine factors that influence transmission duration. Then, test these factors utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to identify an optimal single-pin satellite-linked tag design, and evaluate this prototype through field studies. A review of four projects, which deployed 77 single-pin radio tags, determined that tags attached along the lower third of the dorsal fin and approximately 33 mm from the trailing edge resulted in longer transmission durations and reduced negative impacts to the dorsal fin. Based upon these results and CFD modeling, prototype, single-pin satellite-linked tags (n = 25) transmitted for 163 +/- 22 d (mean +/- 95% CI) which greatly exceeded transmissions for previous small cetacean telemetry studies.

Both groups specialise on food supplies which, in particular regions, fluctuate more than 100-fold from year to year. However, seedcrops in widely separated regions may fluctuate independently of one another, as may rodent populations, so that poor food supplies in one region may coincide with good supplies in another. If individuals are to have access to rich food supplies every year, they must often move hundreds or thousands of kilometres from one breeding area to another. In years of widespread food shortage (or high numbers relative to food supplies) extending over many thousands or millions of square kilometres, large numbers of individuals migrate to lower latitudes, as an 'irruptive migration'. For these reasons, the distribution of the population, in both summer and winter, varies greatly from year to year.
In irruptive migrants, in contrast to regular migrants, site fidelity is poor, and few individuals return to the same breeding areas in successive years (apart from owls in the increase phase of the cycle). Moreover, ring recoveries and radio-tracking confirm that the same individuals can breed in different years in areas separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres. Extreme examples are provided by Common Crossbills Loxia curvirostra in which individual adults were found at localities up to 3200 km apart in different breeding seasons, and Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca at localities up to 2000 km apart. The implication from irruptive migrations, that individuals can winter in widely separated localities in different years, is also supported by ring recoveries, at least in seed-eaters, in which individuals have been found in one winter hundreds or thousands of kilometres from where they were ringed in a previous winter. Most such shifts could be regarded as lying at different points on the same migration axis, but some were apparently on different axes, as the birds were recovered in winter far to the east or west of where they were ringed in a previous winter. Extreme examples included a Bohemian Waxwing Bombycilla garrulus (6000 km, Ukraine to Siberia), a Eurasian Siskin Carduelis spinus (3000 km, Sweden to Iran), a Pine Siskin C. pinus (3950 km, Quebec to California), and a Common Redpoll C. flammea (8350 km, Belgium to China).
Compared to regular (obligate) migrants, irruptive (facultative) migrants show much greater year to year variations in the proportions of individuals that migrate, and greater individual and year to year variations in the timing, directions and distances of movements. The control systems are flexible in irruptive migrants, enabling individuals to respond to feeding conditions at the time. However, regular and irruptive migrants are probably best regarded, not as distinct categories, but as representing opposite extremes of a continuum of migratory behaviour found among birds, from narrow and consistent at one end to broad and flexible at the other. Both systems are adaptive, the one to conditions in which resource levels are predictable in space and time, and the other to conditions in which resource levels are unpredictable. Depending on the predictability and stability of its food supply, the same species may behave as a resident or regular migrant in one part of its range, and as an irruptive migrant in another, as exemplified by particular species of both seed-eaters and rodent-eaters.",NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,NA,2006,nodoi2514952436,"Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Moks Wood Res Stn, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England.","Newton, I (reprint author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Moks Wood Res Stn, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, Cambs, England.",NA

We compared differences among archived GPS (GPS), transmitted GPS (GPS-t) and Argos satellite (PTT) tracks acquired simultaneously on 30 northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus. We examined times and distances between locations, as well as overall trip characteristics (e.g. distance traveled and transit rate). The GPS data were also used to test the accuracy of a continuous-time correlated random walk model created to cope with the spatial error and gap times associated with PTT locations. Significantly more GPS locations per day were acquired than PTT locations (31.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 12.0 +/- 0.3, respectively), and the GPS locations were more evenly distributed along the track. The influence of data type (GPS, GPS-t, PTT) varied based on the parameter measured, ranging from different among all (e.g. average transit rate) to no significant difference (e.g. maximum distance traveled). Modeling of both PTT and GPS-t data resulted in tracks with over 79% of predicted locations less than 5 km from the GPS location (average location error: 3.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.7 +/- 0.1 km, respectively).

Use of geologgers on small birds has great potential to help address major research and conservation questions, but the method is not without its shortcomings. Among these shortcomings are the need to recapture birds after they have carried a device throughout a migration cycle and the potential for the devices to affect survival and behavior. We examined return rates of birds with geologgers in published and unpublished studies and found no evidence of a general negative effect of geologgers on survival, although there were a few individual studies where such an effect was evident. From these same studies, we found that most currently used harness materials are equivalent in terms of failure rates, and the most reliable geologgers are those made by the British Antarctic Survey (although these were also the largest geologgers used in the studies we examined).

This paper presents a general asymptotic expression, derived under the assumption of shallow environmental gradients, for the population-level flux of organisms moving at a constant speed and reorienting at rates determined by the environmental conditions experienced since the last reorientation. The expression takes the form of an advection-diffusion equation, in which the diffusivity and advection velocity are determined by statistics of the turning algorithm that are directly comparable to empirical observations. This work provides a mechanism with which to systematically evaluate a wide variety of tactic and kinetic strategies for determining turning behaviors.
The model is applied to searchers on spatially-variable, random distributions of discrete resource patches. Such algorithms are functions of the integrated resource density encountered between turns. It is shown that behaviors in which the turning time distribution is a function of integrated density cannot result in taxis. In contrast, behaviors in which the turning rate is a function of integrated density can result in taxis. These two classes of search algorithm differ in that the latter requires the searcher to ""learn"" about its local environment, whereas the former requires no such assessment. This suggests neural or physiological mechanisms for remembering previous encounters may be a biological requirement for searchers on discrete resource distributions.",SPRINGER VERLAG,FEB,1999,101007s002850050145,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Math, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Y4, Canada.","Grunbaum, D (reprint author), Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",NA

Concurrently, the availability of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic systems has increased to levels posing risks to ecological and human health. We use the common loon (Gavia immer) as an upper trophic level bioindicator of aquatic Hg toxicity in freshwater lakes. Multiple endpoints were selected to measure potential negative impacts from MeHg body burdens on behavior, physiology, survival and reproductive success. A robust spatio-temporal dataset was used that included nearly 5,500 loon Hg measurements over an 18-year period. We measured significant changes related to elevated MeHg body burdens, including aberrant incubation behavior, lethargy, and wing area asymmetry. Mercury body burdens in adult loons increased an average of 8.4% per year. Increasing Hg body burdens reduced the number of fledged chicks per territorial pair, with highest risk loons producing 41% fewer fledged young than our reference group. Our multiple endpoints establish adverse effect thresholds for adult loons at 3.0 ug/g (wet weight) in blood and 40.0 ug/g (fresh weight) in feathers.

This behavior can be preparatory to gliding or other controlled aerial behaviors and is ultimately necessary for a successful landing. Aerial righting reflexes have been described historically in various mammals such as cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, and primates. The mechanisms whereby such righting can be accomplished depend on the size of the animal and on anatomical features associated with motion of the limbs and body. Here we apply a comparative approach to the study of aerial righting to explore the diverse strategies used for reorientation in midair. We discuss data for two species of lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus platyurus and the anole Anolis carolinensis, as well as for the first instar of the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, to illustrate size-dependence of this phenomenon and its relevance to subsequent aerial performance in parachuting and gliding animals. Geckos can use rotation of their large tails to reorient their bodies via conservation of angular momentum. Lizards with tails well exceeding snout-vent length, and correspondingly large tail inertia to body inertia ratios, are more effective at creating midair reorientation maneuvers. Moreover, experiments with stick insects, weighing an order of magnitude less than the lizards, suggest that aerodynamic torques acting on the limbs and body may play a dominant role in the righting process for small invertebrates. Both inertial and aerodynamic effects, therefore, can play a role in the control of aerial righting. We propose that aerial righting reflexes are widespread among arboreal vertebrates and arthropods and that they represent an important initial adaptation in the evolution of controlled aerial behavior.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,DEC,2011,101093icbicr114,"[Jusufi, Ardian; Zeng, Yu; Full, Robert J.; Dudley, Robert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Dudley, Robert] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama.","Jusufi, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",NA

Recently, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have become more available for numerous civilian applications. The use of small drones for wildlife surveys as a surrogate for manned aerial surveys is becoming increasingly attractive and has already been implemented with some success. This raises the question of how to process UAS imagery in order to determine the surface area of sampling strips within an acceptable confidence level. For the purpose of wildlife surveys, the estimation of sampling strip surface area needs to be both accurate and quick, and easy to implement. As GPS and an inertial measurement units are commonly integrated within unmanned aircraft platforms, two methods of direct georeferencing were compared here. On the one hand, we used the image footprint projection (IFP) method, which utilizes collinearity equations on each image individually. On the other hand, the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique was used for block orientation and georeferencing. These two methods were compared on eight sampling strips. An absolute orientation of the strip was determined by indirect georeferencing using ground control points. This absolute orientation was considered as the reference and was used for validating the other two methods. The IFP method was demonstrated to be the most accurate and the easiest to implement. It was also found to be less demanding in terms of image quality and overlap. However, even though a flat landscape is the type most widely encountered in wildlife surveys in Africa, we recommend estimating IFP sensitivity at an accentuation of the relief.",TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE,NA,2013,1.01177194008291E+023,"[Lisein, Jonathan; Linchant, Julie; Lejeune, Philippe; Bouche, Philippe; Vermeulen, Cedric] Univ Liege Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Dept Forest Nat & Landscape, Unit Forest & Nat Management, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.","Lisein, J (reprint author), Univ Liege Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Dept Forest Nat & Landscape, Unit Forest & Nat Management, 2 Passage Deportes, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",10_1177_194008291300600405

Yet it is poorly documented how animals, particularly nocturnal mammals, adjust their use of space in response to the moonphase. Here, we asked if an obligate nocturnal mammal, the aerial-hawking common noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula), adjusts its 3-dimensional flight behaviour and habitat use to the lunar period. Using miniaturized GPS loggers, we recorded 3-dimensional flight tracks of N. noctula and related these to a canopy height model derived from aerial laser scans to investigate whether bats adjust forest strata use to moonlight intensities.
Results: Noctules frequently foraged above the canopy of coniferous forest at low moonlight intensities, but switched to using open grasslands and arable fields in nights with high moonlight intensities. During the few occasions when noctules used the forest during moonlit nights, they mostly restricted their use of space to flying below the canopy level. The median overall flight altitude of N. noctula equalled 13 +/- 16 m but reached up to 71 m above ground (97.5% quantile).
Conclusions: Our findings argue against general lunar phobic behaviour of aerial-hawking bats. We suggest that the preferred use of open fields around full moon may be a strategy of noctules to increase the success of hunting airborne insects at night. Specifically, the adjustment in use of space may allow bats to hunt for insects that emerge and disperse over open fields during bright moonlight.",BMC,AUG 2,2018,101186s4046201801317,NA,NA,10_1186_s40462_018_0131_7

The extent to which physiological performance traits affect the spatial positioning of individual fish within schools is completely unknown. Schools of juvenile mullet Liza aurata were filmed at three swim speeds in a swim tunnel, with one focal fish from each school then also measured for standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximal metabolic rate (MMR), aerobic scope (AS) and maximum aerobic swim speed. At faster speeds, fish with lower MMR and AS swam near the rear of schools. These trailing fish required fewer tail beats to swim at the same speed as individuals at the front of schools, indicating that posterior positions provide hydrodynamic benefits that reduce swimming costs. Conversely, fish with high aerobic capacity can withstand increased drag at the leading edge of schools, where they could maximize food intake while possibly retaining sufficient AS for other physiological functions. SMR was never related to position, suggesting that high maintenance costs do not necessarily motivate individuals to occupy frontal positions.

The unifying concept that underlies this emerging discipline is its focus on the planetary boundary layer, or aerosphere, and the myriad of organisms that, in large part, depend upon this environment for their existence. The aerosphere influences both daily and seasonal movements of organisms, and its effects have both short- and long-term consequences for species that use this environment. The biotic interactions and physical conditions in the aerosphere represent important selection pressures that influence traits such as size and shape of organisms, which in turn facilitate both passive and active displacements. The aerosphere also influences the evolution of behavioral, sensory, metabolic, and respiratory functions of organisms in a myriad of ways. In contrast to organisms that depend strictly on terrestrial or aquatic existence, those that routinely use the aerosphere are almost immediately influenced by changing atmospheric conditions (e.g., winds, air density, precipitation, air temperature), sunlight, polarized light, moon light, and geomagnetic and gravitational forces. The aerosphere has direct and indirect effects on organisms, which often are more strongly influenced than those that spend significant amounts of time on land or in water. Future advances in aeroecology will be made when research conducted by biologists is more fully integrated across temporal and spatial scales in concert with advances made by atmospheric scientists and mathematical modelers. Ultimately, understanding how organisms such as arthropods, birds, and bats aloft are influenced by a dynamic aerosphere will be of importance for assessing, and maintaining ecosystem health, human health, and biodiversity.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JUL,2008,101093icbicn037,"[Kunz, Thomas H.; Hristov, Nickolay I.; Horn, Jason W.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA./[Gauthreaux, Sidney A., Jr.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA./[Jones, Gareth] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England./[Kalko, Elisabeth K.

Before any in-field experiments can be conducted, an elephant's olfactory capacity for the detection of the most commonly used component in landmines, trinitrotoluene (TNT), needed to be established. Using three African elephants under controlled conditions, we used operant conditioning to test whether elephants are able to detect and reliably indicate the presence of TNT using olfaction. Elephants detected and indicated TNT using olfaction at levels greater than chance, with high sensitivity and selectivity, even when in the presence of highly volatile distractor odors. Additionally, the sensitivity of detection surpasses that of TNT-detection dogs working under similar conditions, suggesting that the potential application of African elephants within the biosensor-field should not be underestimated.

Individuals should adjust their behavior to make optimal use of the landscape and limit the costs of trade-offs emerging from the use of these resources. Here we study how African elephants Loxodonta africana travel to foraging places between regular visits to waterholes. Elephant herds were tracked using GPS collars during two consecutive dry seasons in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We segmented each individual movement track at each visit to water to define foraging trips, and then used trip-level statistics to build an understanding of movement strategies. Travel speed within these individually-consistent movement bouts was also analyzed to understand if speed was better linked to distance to water or progression in the trip over time. We found that elephants went further from water when drinking less often, which could result from a trade-off between drinking and foraging in less depleted, far from water, places. Speed increased towards the beginning and the end of the trips, and was also greater than observed during the wet season, suggesting that elephants were trying to save time. Numerous short trips traveled at greater speed, particularly when commuting to a different waterhole, was tentatively explained by the inability to drink at specific waterholes due to intra-specific interference. Unexpectedly elephants did not always minimize travel time by drinking at the closest waterhole, but the extra distance traveled remained never more than a few kilometers. Our results show how individuals may adjust movement behavior to deal with resource trade-offs at the landscape scale.

We broadcast pre-recorded elephant calls to elephants that were 1.2 and 2.0 km from the speaker while making simultaneous video and audio recordings of their behavior.  In order to reduce the risk of habituation, we used a variety of call types as stimuli.  Elephants responded to playbacks at both 1.2 and 2.0 km, with a full response consisting of the elephant vocalizing, lifting and spreading its ears, remaining motionless in this position ('freezing'), moving the head from side to side ('scanning') and, in the case of males responding to female estrous calls, orienting to and finally walking 1 km or more towards the loudspeaker.
We analyzed our data quantitatively for three of these responses.  The occurrence of each behavior increased substantially immediately after playbacks.
Owing to limitations of the loudspeaker, we were only able to broadcast calls at half the sound pressure level (i.e. -6 dB) of the strongest calls we have recorded.  Since sound at the frequencies of these calls is predicted to suffer from little, if any, attenuation in excess of that caused by spherical spreading, we estimate these calls to be audible to elephants at least 4 km from the source (twice the distance over which we documented responses).
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the very low-frequency calls of elephants function in communication between individuals and groups of elephants separated by distances of several kilometers.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,MAY,1991,nodoi5372581739,"WASHINGTON PK ZOO,PORTLAND,OR 97221.","LANGBAUER, WR (reprint author), CORNELL LAB ORNITHOL,ITHACA,NY 14850, USA.",NA
AGE AND CONTEXT AFFECT THE STEREOTYPIES OF CAGED MINK,12691,"MASON, GJ",BEHAVIOUR,TETHERED SOWS; JUMPING STEREOTYPY; FOOD RESTRICTION; BEHAVIOR; STRESS,NA,"The effects of age and context on the stereotypies of caged mink were examined in order to assess the developmental changes undergone by the behaviour, and to find context- specificity that might suggest its motivational bases. Caged mink perform stereotypies consisting of a variety of movements, most commonly pacing and rearing, running in and out of the nestbox, and stationary head-twirling or nodding. Stereotypies are largely performed as feeding-time approaches, and many mink do not show them al all once fed. Stereotypies become more frequent and less variable with age; and in adults, individuals with the highest levels of stereotypy show the least variable forms of the behaviour and are most likely to perform it in more than one context, Le. not solely in the pre-feeding period. These data suggest that mink stereotypies become 'established' with age, in the manner described for stereotypies in other species. However, the behaviour of kits does not follow the pattern seen in adults: kits performing stereotypies in more than one context do not have particularly high levels of the behaviour, nor are their stereotypies particularly unvarying. In addition, post-feeding stereotypies are commonly shown even by very young animals. Thus it cannot be the case that mink stereotypies are performed first in the prefeeding situation and only later in other contexts via a process of emancipation. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the forms of the behaviour often differ pre- and post-feeding. The specific forms and contexts of mink stereotypies suggest certain motivational bases for the behaviour. The rise in stereotypies as feeding time approaches and the sustained levels seen when the animals are not fed indicate hunger as an important factor, and in one dataset, the individuals whose stereotypies were solely pre-feeding used the most Longitudinal movements (i.e. pacing and its variants). This suggests that stereotypies, and pacing movements in particular, may stem from appetitive, food-searching behaviour. In contrast, Stationary movements such as head-twirling are performed more in the hours after feeding, and in one group of mink their levels declined over the pre-feeding period as feeding time approached. The physical appearance of such movements suggests they might be derived from attempts to escape the cage. Thus mink stereotypies are probably seen in a range of contexts because they develop from several different behaviour patterns, with different motivational bases. The link, in adults, between performance in this range of contexts and the degree of establishment of the behaviour may be explained in one of two ways. In one adult group the data suggest that animals with stereotypy in more than one context incorporate the typically post-feeding Stationary movements into their prefeeding behaviour, as if emancipation of this movement had occurred. However, data from the other adult group do not support this hypothesis, and the degree of establishment and the number of contexts in which stereotypies are performed may not be causally linked at all, but instead the independent products of individual propensities to develop stereotypic behaviour. Sex and site differences have yet to be fully explained. Females show consistently higher levels of stereotypy than males, as if perhaps they find the environment more frustrating. There are also enormous differences in the frequency and incidence of the behaviour on the two different sites studied.",E J BRILL,DEC,1993,101163156853993X00029,NA,"MASON, GJ (reprint author), UNIV CAMBRIDGE,SUBDEPT ANIM BEHAV,CAMBRIDGE CB3 8AA,ENGLAND.",NA

We used telemetry data to provide insight into the causes and consequences of local and long-distance movements of multiple age classes of conservation-reliant golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the foothills and mountains near Tehachapi, California. We estimated size and habitat-related correlates of 324 monthly 95 % home ranges and 317 monthly 50 % core areas for 25 birds moving locally over 2.5 years. We also calculated daily, hourly, and total distances traveled for the five of these birds that engaged in long-distance movements. Mean (+/- SD) monthly home-range size was 253.6 +/- 429.4 km(2) and core-area size was 26.4 +/- 49.7 km(2). Consistent with expectations, space used by pre-adults increased with age and was season-dependent but, unexpectedly, was not sex-dependent. For all ages and sexes, home ranges and core areas were dominated by both forest & woodland and shrubland & grassland habitat types. When moving long distances, eagles traveled up to 1588.4 km (1-way) in a season at highly variable speeds (63.7 +/- 69.0 km/day and 5.2 +/- 10.4 km/h) that were dependent on time of day. Patterns of long-distance movements by eagles were determined by age, yet these movements had characteristics of more than one previously described movement category (migration, dispersal, etc.). Our results provide a context for differentiating among types of movement behaviors and their population-level consequences and, thus, have implications for management and conservation of golden eagle populations.",SPRINGER,AUG,2016,101007s1034401610104,"[Poessel, Sharon A.; Katzner, Todd E.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, 970 S Lusk St, Boise, ID 83706 USA./[Bloom, Peter H.] Western Fdn Vertebrate Zool, 439 Calle San Pablo, Camarillo, CA 93012 USA./[Braham, Melissa A.] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.","Poessel, SA (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, 970 S Lusk St, Boise, ID 83706 USA.",10_1007_s10344_016_1010_4

Yet, the few tropical species that have been studied show a variety of behavioural traits beyond those described in temperate species. Here we reveal both age and sexual differences in the movements of tropical green pythons (Morelia viridis: Pythonidae). We radio-tracked 27 individuals (17 females and 10 males) for up to 18 months, locating individuals during both the day and night. The home range size for adult females (mean +/- SE of 6.21 +/- 1.85 ha) was correlated with snout-vent length. Neither adult males nor juveniles had a stable home range. Adult females had stable home ranges that overlapped considerably with those of other females and yellow individuals. Multiple radio-tracked adult males passed through the territory of radio-tracked adult females during the study. Females of all sizes were more likely to change position each day than males. There were no differences between the sexes or size categories in the distances moved in most months, although the variation in movement distances was higher in the dry season than during the wet season. In the wet season (January-March) movement distances increased and these were size- and sex-related. This increased activity may be associated with mate searching. Males of M. viridis may maximize their rate of encountering mature females by roaming rather than maintaining a home range. Juvenile green pythons moved distances equal to adult snakes in most months despite their comparatively small size.",BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,AUG,2006,101111j14429993200601519x,"Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia./Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.","Wilson, D (reprint author), Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",NA

Dinse, Hubert R.",PLOS ONE,NA,NA,"Background. The decline of motor performance of the human hand-arm system with age is well-documented. While dominant hand performance is superior to that of the non-dominant hand in young individuals, little is known of possible age-related changes in hand dominance. We investigated age-related alterations of hand dominance in 20 to 90 year old subjects. All subjects were unambiguously right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. In Experiment 1, motor performance for aiming, postural tremor, precision of arm-hand movement, speed of arm-hand movement, and wrist-finger speed tasks were tested. In Experiment 2, accelerometer-sensors were used to obtain objective records of hand use in everyday activities. Principal Findings. Our data confirm previous findings of a general task-dependent decline in motor performance with age. Analysis of the relationship between right/left-hand performances using a laterality index showed a loss of right hand dominance with advancing age. The clear right-hand advantage present at younger ages changed to a more balanced performance in advanced age. This shift was due to a more pronounced age-related decline of right hand performance. Accelerometer-sensor measurements supported these findings by demonstrating that the frequency of hand use also shifted from a clear right hand preference in young adults to a more balanced usage of both hands in old age. Despite these age-related changes in the relative level of performance in defined motor tasks and in the frequency of hand use, elderly subjects continued to rate themselves as unambiguous right-handers. Conclusion. The discrepancy between hand-specific practical performance in controlled motor tests as well as under everyday conditions and the results of questionnaires concerning hand use and hand dominance suggests that most elderly subjects are unaware of the changes in hand dominance that occur over their lifespan, i.e., a shift to ambidexterity.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,DEC 20,2006,101371journalpone0000090,"[Kalisch, Tobias; Wilimzig, Claudia; Kleibel, Nadine; Dinse, Hubert R.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Theoret Biol, Neural Plast Lab, Inst Neuroinformat, Bochum, Germany./[Wilimzig, Claudia] CALTECH, Div Biol, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA./[Tegenthoff, Martin] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Neurol, BG Kliniken Bergmannsheil, Bochum, Germany.","Dinse, HR (reprint author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Theoret Biol, Neural Plast Lab, Inst Neuroinformat, Bochum, Germany.",10_1371_journal_pone_0000090

The purpose of this study was to examine age-related differences in reaction time (RT) and the pattern of temporal coordination between center of pressure (COP), trunk and head motion during voluntary postural sway movements. Healthy young (n = 10: mean = 24 years; SD = 5 years) and elderly men (n = 8; mean = 75 years: SD = 2 years) stood on a force plate with tri-axial accelerometers attached to the head and lower trunk. Participants were required to generate sway in the anterior-posterior (AP) or medial-lateral (ML) direction in response to an auditory cue during two different testing conditions called Static reaction and Dynamic reaction. Static reactions involved the initiation of voluntary sway in either the AP or ML direction from quiet stance. Dynamic reactions involved an orthogonal switch of voluntary sway between the AP and ML directions. Compared to the young, elderly individuals exhibited slower RT during both Static and Dynamic reaction, and smaller differences in RT and phasing between COP, trunk, and head motion. The results of this study suggest that the elderly adopted more rigid coordination strategies compared to the young when executing a rapid change in direction of whole body motion. The rigid movement strategy of the elderly was presumably generated in an effort to compensate for increased challenge to the maintenance of stability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We have a limited understanding of the effects of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on physical activity (PA), and we have no prevalence estimates of the daily movement patterns among Americans with AMD. Therefore, we examined the association between AMD and PA and provided estimates of the daily movement patterns of Americans with AMD.
Methods
Data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used, including 1,656 adults (40-85 yrs). Retinal imaging was performed to classify individuals as no AMD, early AMD, or late AMD. Participants wore an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer for 7 days to measure PA behavior.
Results
93.2% of participants with late AMD were in the least desirable group (not sufficiently active and having a negative light intensity-sedentary behavior balance). After adjustments (including age), participants with late AMD, as compared to those with no AMD, engaged in 50% less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (RR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.28-0.90). When visual acuity was entered into the model along with the other covariates, the association between late AMD and MVPA was no longer significant (RR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.29-1.01), suggesting that visual acuity may partially mediate this relationship.
Conclusions
Individuals with late AMD engage in very little moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Visually acuity, in part, explains the relationship between late AMD and PA.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 1,2015,101371journalpone0125394,"[Loprinzi, Paul D.] Univ Mississippi, Ctr Hlth Behav Res, Dept Hlth Exercise Sci & Recreat Management, University, MS 38677 USA./[Swenor, Bonnielin K.; Ramulu, Pradeep Y.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Wilmer Eye Inst, Baltimore, MD USA.","Loprinzi, PD (reprint author), Univ Mississippi, Ctr Hlth Behav Res, Dept Hlth Exercise Sci & Recreat Management, University, MS 38677 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0125394

Foraging efficiency is a key determinant of fitness, with implications for individual life history trade-offs. A variety of faculties known to decline in old age, such as muscular function and visual acuity, are likely to influence foraging performance. We examine age-related variation in the foraging behaviour of a long-lived, wide-ranging oceanic seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans. Using miniaturised tracking technologies, we compared foraging trip characteristics of birds breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia. Based on movement and immersion data collected during the incubation phase of a single breeding season, and from extensive tracking data collected in previous years from different stages of the breeding cycle, we found limited evidence for age-related variation in commonly reported trip parameters, and failed to detect signs of senescent decline. Our results contrast with the limited number of past studies that have examined foraging behaviour in later life, since these have documented changes in performance consistent with senescence.

Senescence has been widely documented in wild vertebrate populations, yet the proximate drivers of age-related declines in breeding success, including allocation trade-offs and links with foraging performance, are poorly understood. For long-lived, migratory species, the non-breeding period represents a critical time for investment in self-maintenance and restoration of body condition, which in many species is linked to fitness. However, the relationships between age, non-breeding foraging behaviour and fitness remain largely unexplored.
2. We performed a cross-sectional study, investigating age-related variation in the foraging activity, distribution and diet of an extremely long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, during the non-breeding period. Eighty-two adults aged 8-33years were tracked with geolocator-immersion loggers, and body feathers were sampled for stable isotope analysis. We tested for variation in metrics of foraging behaviour and linked age-related trends to subsequent reproductive performance.
3. There was an age-related decline in the number of landings (a proxy of foraging effort) during daylight hours, and a decrease in body feather C-13 values in older males but not females, yet this did not accompany an age-related shift in distributions. Males conducted fewer landings than females, and the sexes showed some spatial segregation, with males foraging further south, likely due to their differential utilization of winds.
4. Although younger (<20years) birds had higher foraging effort, they all went on to breed successfully the following season. In contrast, among older (20+ years) birds, individuals that landed more often were more likely to defer breeding or fail during incubation, suggesting they have lower foraging success.
5. As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of an age-specific carry-over effect of foraging behaviour in the non-breeding period on subsequent reproductive performance. This link between foraging behaviour and fitness in late but not early adulthood indicates that the ability of individuals to forage efficiently outside the breeding period may be an important driver of fitness differences in old age.",WILEY,JUL,2018,1.01111136524351E+018,"[Clay, Thomas A.; Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge, England./[Clay, Thomas A.; Pearmain, Elizabeth J.; Manica, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge, England./[McGill, Rona A.

However, researchers have sparse information on the degree to which age-sex classes fit the generic trends and the influence of habitat structure on them. We compare the activity budget, dietary composition, and positional behavior by age-sex or age classes in a group of black-and-gold howlers (Alouatta caraya) in a small orchard forest. We collected 26,474 behavioral records via instantaneous scan sampling over 1 yr. The main activity was resting (56%) and the diet comprised mainly leaves (82%); sitting was the most adopted feeding (61%) and resting (52%) posture, and walking was the most prevalent locomotor mode (38%). There are age-sex differences for all major behaviors. Whereas resting tended to increase with body size, moving decreased. We observed no difference in the consumption of major plant parts. There were ontogenetic differences in most positional behaviors. Sitting increased from infants to adults during feeding, whereas the opposite occurred for bridging and hanging. During resting, infants curled more and lay less than the other classes did, whereas adults engaged in more sitting. Adults and subadults walked more than individuals of other ages did; infants climbed and bridged more than others did; and, there were opposing trends in leaping and descending.

The efficiency of foraging is an effect of both the animal behavior and the geometry of the landscape; furthermore, the landscape is itself affected by the foraging of animals. We investigated the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the efficiency of an optimal forager. The particular aspect of heterogeneity we considered was ""clumpiness""- the degree to which food resource patches are clustered together. The starting point for our study was the framework of the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) by Charnov. Since MVT is not spatially explicit, and thus not apt to investigate effects of clumpiness, we built an agent-based (or individual-based) model for animal movement in discrete landscapes extending the MVT. We also constructed a model for generating landscapes where the clumpiness of patches can be easily controlled, or ""tuned"", by an input parameter. We evaluated the agent based model by comparing the results with what the MTV would give, i.e. if the spatial effects were removed. The MVT matched the simulations best on landscapes with random patch configuration and high food recovery rates. As for our main question about the effects of clumpiness, we found that, when landscapes were highly productive (rapid food replenishment), foraging efficiency was greatest in clumped landscapes. In less productive landscapes, however, foraging efficiency was lowest in landscapes with a clumped patch distribution.",WILEY,DEC,2007,101111j20070906759005148x,"[Nonaka, Etsuko] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA./Univ New Mexico, Dept Comp, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.","Nonaka, E (reprint author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",NA

Simulation models, which are a simplification of a real-world system, can help understand the effects of change of such dynamic behavior. In this paper, agent-based modeling and simulation is proposed, that describes the dynamic action of an agent, i.e., taxi, governed by behavior rules and properties, which emulate the taxi behavior. Taxi behavior simulations are fundamentally done for optimizing the service level for both taxi drivers as well as passengers. Moreover, simulation techniques, as such, could be applied to another field of application as well, where obtaining real raw data are somewhat difficult due to privacy issues, such as human mobility data or call detail record data. This paper describes the development of an agent-based simulation model which is based on multiple input parameters (taxi stay point cluster; trip information (origin and destination); taxi demand information; free taxi movement; and network travel time) that were derived from taxi probe GPS data. As such, agent's parameters were mapped into grid network, and the road network, for which the grid network was used as a base for query/search/retrieval of taxi agent's parameters, while the actual movement of taxi agents was on the road network with routing and interpolation. The results obtained from the simulated taxi agent data and real taxi data showed a significant level of similarity of different taxi behavior, such as trip generation; trip time; trip distance as well as trip occupancy, based on its distribution.

Daily water temperatures were recorded at the aggregation area from 1993 to 1995. The annual aggregation cycle did not coincide with maximum or minimum annual water temperatures. During the 1994 aggregation, temperatures were recorded at least every hour at 7 sites in the Atoll. The sharks aggregated most frequently and in highest numbers at the largest and shallowest site, which also contained the fewest underwater structures. The water temperature at this site was 1-2 degrees C warmer than at neighboring sites and at a reef channel between the lagoon and the open ocean. The pattern of movement of sharks to and from the aggregation area was correlated with daily fluctuations of water temperature (r = 0.38; p < 0.001), tide (r = 0.30; p < 0.001) and light level (r = 0.21; p < 0.001) after adjustment for autocorrelated errors. The daily maximum number of aggregating sharks coincided with the daily maximum water temperature. However, the number of aggregating sharks did not necessarily increase during days of higher water temperature. During the 1994 aggregation period, four sharks were fed ultrasonic telemetry tags, and telemetry stations were deployed at three sites within the aggregation area. Individual sharks were tracked returning to the aggregation area for durations of one to five days. The end of detection of tagged sharks is thought to be due to the regurgitation of the indigestible tags, rather than the sharks permanent departure from the aggregating area.

In two successive years, we surgically implanted transmitters in male and female bonefish (n = 60) and examined their movement patterns within the array. Eight bonefish surgically implanted with transmitters as part of an earlier study were also tracked. In 2009, the telemetry information was complemented with snorkeling observations, underwater video, and manual tracking of the same acoustically tagged fish, as well as fish (n = 3) gastrically implanted with continuous transmitters. During a period of 4-7 days spanning the full and new moons, primarily between October and May, bonefish moved from their typical shallow flats and aggregated at sites in close proximity to the deep water drop-off of the Exuma Sound. Localized movements of the large schools of bonefish (often > 1,000 fish) at these presumptive pre-spawning aggregation sites included brief trips (< 8 h) just after sunset until just prior to sunrise to the abyssal wall at the edge of the Exuma Sound (i.e., > 1,000 m depth). Tagged bonefish detected at these aggregation sites were subsequently detected back in the tidal creeks and coastal flats shortly after new and full moons and remained at these more typical shallow sites (i.e., < 2 m depth). Although we did not directly observe spawning events, we did observe ventral nudging and porpoising behaviors, which are potentially associated with courtship. Timing of the observed movements and possible courtship behaviors was coincident with periods when gametes were well developed. Collectively, our study provides the first objective evidence suggesting that the aggregation and seasonal migration of bonefish to deep shelf environments during certain moon phases is for spawning.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,SEP,2011,101007s0022701117076,"[Danylchuk, Andy J.; Haak, Christopher R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA./[Danylchuk, Andy J.; Cooke, Steven J.; Goldberg, Tony L.; Suski, Cory D.; Murchie, Karen J.; Danylchuk, Sascha E.; Shultz, Aaron D.; Haak, Christopher R.; Brooks, Edd J.; Oronti, Annabelle; Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Flats Ecol & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas./[Cooke, Steven J.; Murchie, Karen J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada./[Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada./[Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA./[Suski, Cory D.; Shultz, Aaron D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA./[Brooks, Edd J.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England./[Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.","Danylchuk, AJ (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 311 Holdsworth Hall,160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",10_1007_s00227_011_1707_6

Aggressive individuals may experience an increase in agonistic interactions and contact rates with conspecifics, which might increase their probability of acquiring parasites. However, aggression is not the only factor that shapes parasitism; proximate mechanisms like hormone-modulated immunosuppression can also have broad impacts. Here, we hypothesized that high levels of aggression, cortisol and testosterone would be positively associated with parasitism and that aggressive individuals would play a larger role spreading parasites to conspecifics than would docile individuals. We measured aggression using the level of aggressive response to human handling during capture. Our aim was to examine associations between aggression and hormones (cortisol and testosterone) on variation in endo-and ectoparasitism in a population of wild mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) over a 3-year period. By tracking the movement of lice (directly transmitted parasites) in the population, we also examined the effect of host aggression on population-wide parasite dynamics. We show that animals with high testosterone and cortisol were more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviours, and cortisol was associated with significantly higher ectoparasite infestations. Aggressive individuals were significantly more infested by lice, and also donated significantly more lice to conspecifics in the population. Taken together, our results offer insight into the individual and population health costs of aggression, and empirical support of a trade-off between aggression and ectoparasitism, which may have driven the evolution of aggression and interactions with conspecifics.

invasive species; range expansion; reptile","Personality-dependent dispersal is a key ecological and evolutionary process that is likely to facilitate the successful movement and colonization/invasion success of species. This dispersal syndrome suggests that dispersers should possess a suite of behavioural tendencies that differ from those of nondispersers, thus influencing the composition of populations in the new range and, ultimately, colonization success. However, dispersal is also often condition dependent, and is probably mediated by the interaction between an individual's personality and environmental and social factors such as competition. Accordingly, we investigated whether dispersal tendency was linked to an activity, exploration and social syndrome and/or aggression in a reptile, the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, which has had a successful invasion history via accidental introductions. Contrary to our prediction, we found that dispersal was not related to activity, exploration or social personality traits. Instead, dispersal tendency was associated with aggression: the most aggressive individuals dispersed further and faster than less aggressive individuals. The presence of aggression-dependent dispersal could be due to either (1) dispersers generally being more aggressive than nondispersers or (2) aggressive individuals forcing nonaggressive individuals into hiding, thus impinging on the ability of subordinates to disperse regardless of their personality. Our study highlights the need to consider the ecological context when examining personality-dependent dispersal and suggests that aggression and the social environment can play an important role in dispersal decisions.

foraging; Somateria mollissima; spatial position; vigilance","Decreased risk of predation is a key benefit of group living, and selfish herd theory predicts competition for the relative safety of central positions. Spatial position also affects behaviour, as individuals trade-off their feeding and vigilance to mitigate the risk of predation. Female eiders, Somateria mollissima, often pool their broods and share brood rearing, and anti-predatory vigilance is a core parental care activity. Females are assumed to trade-off vigilance and feeding, as efficient recovery of condition is crucial for energetically stressed postincubating females. Evidence shows that a female's own ducklings are closer to her than unrelated young in amalgamated broods and that predation of ducklings by gulls is edge biased, so a female's spatial position should correlate with the survival prospects of her brood. We identified determinants of female spatial position (aggression, structural size, body weight, age, clutch size) within multifemale brood-rearing coalitions, and explored whether spatial position affected female activities. Female aggression frequency was the only significant predictor of centrality in brood-rearing coalitions, and female age was positively associated with aggression. Investment in vigilance, but not investment in feeding, increased with spatial centrality; instead, central females devoted less time to other activities (resting, preening and moving). We conclude that central eider females do not need to trade-off vigilance and feeding. Heavy body weight did not guarantee a favourable position in brood-rearing coalitions, which may help explain our previous finding that female eiders in best body condition when their brood hatches tend their brood alone.

We describe and quantify 18 behaviour patterns (both social and agonistic) of this species, some of which have not been described before for other scincids. Video recordings of male-male, female-female, and male-female interactions were made under laboratory conditions, with controlled light-dark cycle and temperature. We describe several agonistic and courtship behaviour patterns. Within the first context, we detected a new agonistic behaviour for a scincid, ""Snout to body"", that appeared at the beginning of agonistic sequences; it consisted of each animal placing its snout in contact with the other individual's lateral side of the body. The amplitude of head movement during ""Head bobbing"" was lower than that described for many other lizard species. Agonistic behaviours were shown in intrasexual staged encounters both within males and females. The comparison of behaviour patterns of both types of intrasexual encounters showed that females were more active, exhibiting significantly higher frequencies of behaviour than males. Specifically, females showed the ""Snout to body"" pattern more frequently than males. In male-female encounters we detected courtship and copulation patterns only in April, when males performed ""Bites"" and ""Snout to body"" directed at females.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,APR,2012,101007s1021101101096,"[Sanchez-Hernandez, Paula; Molina-Borja, Miguel] Univ La Laguna, Fac Biol, Depto Biol Anim, Grp Etol & Ecol Comportamiento, Tenerife, Islas Canarias, Spain./[Ramirez-Pinilla, Martha P.] Univ Ind Santander, Escuela Biol, Grp Estudios Biodiversidad, Bucaramanga, Colombia.","Molina-Borja, M (reprint author), Univ La Laguna, Fac Biol, Depto Biol Anim, Grp Etol & Ecol Comportamiento, Tenerife, Islas Canarias, Spain.",10_1007_s10211_011_0109_6

conflict; migration; pastures; saltmarsh","1. Broad-scale land conversions and fertilizer use have dramatically altered the available staging area for herbivorous long-distance migrants. Instead of natural land, these birds rely increasingly on pastures for migratory fuelling and stopover, often conflicting with farming practices. To predict and manage birds' future habitat use, the relative advantages and disadvantages of natural (e.g. saltmarsh, intertidal) versus anthropogenic staging sites for foraging need to be understood.
2. We compared the migratory staging of brent geese on saltmarsh and pasture sites in spring. Food quality (nitrogen and fibre content), antagonistic behaviour, and body weight were quantified at nearby sites in simultaneous seasons. Individuals were tracked with high-resolution GPS and accelerometers to compare timing of migration and time budgets during fuelling.
3. On pastures, birds rested more and experienced higher ingestion rates, similar or superior food quality and reduced antagonistic interactions than on saltmarsh.
4. Brent geese using fertilized grasslands advanced their fuelling and migration schedules compared to those using saltmarsh. Pasture birds reached heavy weights earlier, departed sooner, and arrived in the Arctic earlier.
5. Intertidal mudflats were frequently visited by saltmarsh birds during the day, and available food there (algae, some seagrass) was of higher quality than terrestrial resources. Availability of intertidal resources was an important factor balancing the otherwise more favourable conditions on pastures relative to saltmarsh.
6. Synthesis and applications. Disadvantages of longer foraging effort, more antagonistic interactions and delayed fuelling schedules on traditional saltmarshes may cause geese to exchange this traditional niche in favour of pastures, especially in a warming climate that requires advancement of migratory schedules. However, due to its high quality, intertidal forage can complement terrestrial foraging, potentially removing the incentive for habitat switches to pastures. The relatively high quality of green algae and seagrass, and birds' remarkable preference for these resources when available, provides a key for managers to create landscapes that can sustain this specialist's intertidal lifestyle. To keep natural habitats attractive to staging geese with the purpose of preventing conflicts with farming practices, management actions should focus on conservation and restoration of saltmarsh and especially intertidal habitat.",WILEY,NOV,2018,1.01111136526641E+018,"[Dokter, Adriaan M.; van der Jeugd, Henk P.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Ctr Avian Migrat & Demog, Wageningen, Netherlands./[Dokter, Adriaan M.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA./[Dokter, Adriaan M.; Nolet, Bart A.] Univ Amsterdam, Theoret & Computat Ecol, Amsterdam, Netherlands./[Fokkema, Wimke; Olff, Han] Univ Groningen, Conservat Ecol, Groningen, Netherlands./[Ebbinge, Barwolt S.] Wageningen Environm Res Alterra, Team Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands./[van der Jeugd, Henk P.; Nolet, Bart A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands.","Dokter, AM (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",10_1111_1365_2664_13168

Most important, current spaceborne sensors are not able to ensure flexible monitoring of critical regions. Airborne sensors may overcome most of the problems mentioned above, but up to now, the operational use of airborne differential SAR interferometry has been prevented by insufficiently accurate motion compensation of the platform.

Our understanding of the actual needs of the critically endangered Sumatran elephant in this context is insufficient.
Aims. Provide reliable subspecies-specific information on home range size and habitat selection of Sumatran elephants.
Methods. Using both the new area-corrected autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE(C)) and two commonly applied conventional methods, the home range sizes of nine Sumatran elephants were estimated. Elephant habitat selection was studied using Manly's selection ratios.
Key results. AKDE(C) home ranges of adults ranged from 275 km(2) to 1352 km(2). Estimates obtained using conventional KDE and minimum convex polygon (MCP) ranged between 156 km(2) and 997 km(2). Overall habitat selection was significant for both slope and land-cover type, whereas individual preferences varied to some extent. On the basis of global selection ratios, we found natural forest, pulpwood plantations and gentle slopes (<= 4 degrees) to be significantly selected, whereas most areas affected by human activities and steeper slopes were avoided by the majority of animals included in the study.
Conclusions. As expected, AKDE(C) estimates were much larger than those obtained using conventional methods because conventional methods have a tendency to underestimate home range size when confronted with autocorrelated movement data and produce estimates that refer to the limited study period only, whereas AKDE(C) estimates include the predicted animal's long-term space use. The extremely large AKDE(C) estimate obtained for a subadult male most likely represents a combination of population dispersal range and temporary home range rather than its final adult home range. Regardless, it appears that Sumatran elephants roam over much larger areas than previously assumed. Natural forests and relatively flat areas are of great importance for Sumatran elephants. The observed intensive use of pulpwood plantations by one individual is likely because of limited availability of alternative suitable habitats.
Implications. Alandscape-wide approach to elephant conservation that takes large home ranges into account, is required, and should include forest protection and restoration and elephant friendly management of existing pulpwood concessions, with special focus on areas with relatively gentle slopes.",NA,NA,2016,101071WR16069,NA,NA,NA

We conducted frame-by-frame analyses of gait timing and leg movement from video recordings of alarm walking and normal walking. Compared with normal walking, contact durations of all legs during alarm walking were greater and deer lifted their foreleg carpal joint higher off the ground, suggesting that alarm walking requires a level of control and flexibility in leg movement not possible in arthritic or lame individuals. Although phases of limb movement (i.e., midtime lag between fore and hind legs) were reliably different, there was no difference in the angle of foreleg lifting between the 2 walking styles. Performance of alarm walking was correlated with foot stamping, and was observed more often when the predator model was out of view. Although there was no direct evidence supporting any 1 function of alarm walking, available evidence suggests that alarm walking might have the dual function of signaling to a stealthy predator that it has been detected and that the displaying deer is healthy and capable of escaping, both of which should deter further pursuit.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JUN,2008,10164407MAMMA203R1,"[Stankowich, Theodore] Univ Massachusetts, Morrill Sci Ctr S, Amherst, MA 01003 USA./[Stankowich, Theodore] Univ Calif Bodega, Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA./[Coss, Richard G.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Dept Psychol, Livermore, CA 95616 USA.","Stankowich, T (reprint author), Univ Massachusetts, Morrill Sci Ctr S, 611 N Pleasant St, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",NA

Yet, much of the site-specific information we have about the bears in this relationship comes from observations at a few highly visible but unrepresentative locations and a small number of radio-telemetry studies. Consequently, our understanding of brown bear abundance and behavior at more cryptic locations where they commonly feed on salmon, including small spawning streams, remains limited. We employed a noninvasive genetic approach (barbed wire hair snares) over four summers (2012-2015) to document patterns of brown bear abundance and movement among six spawning streams for sockeye salmon, O.nerka, in southwestern Alaska. The streams were grouped into two trios on opposite sides of Lake Aleknagik. Thus, we predicted that most bears would forage within only one trio during the spawning season because of the energetic costs associated with swimming between them or traveling around the lake and show fidelity to particular trios across years because of the benefits of familiarity with local salmon dynamics and stream characteristics. Huggins closed-capture models based on encounter histories from genotyped hair samples revealed that as many as 41 individuals visited single streams during the annual 6-week sampling season. Bears also moved freely among trios of streams but rarely moved between these putative foraging neighborhoods, either during or between years. By implication, even small salmon spawning streams can serve as important resources for brown bears, and consistent use of stream neighborhoods by certain bears may play an important role in spatially structuring coastal bear populations. Our findings also underscore the efficacy of noninvasive hair snagging and genetic analysis for examining bear abundance and movements at relatively fine spatial and temporal scales.",WILEY,SEP,2018,101002ece34431,"[Wirsing, Aaron J.; Craig, Apryle D.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./[Quinn, Thomas P.; Cunningham, Curry J.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./[Adams, Jennifer R.; Waits, Lisette P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.","Wirsing, AJ (reprint author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",10_1002_ece3_4431

We tracked by satellite telemetry the dispersal and migration of 13 juvenile wandering albatrosses from the Crozet Islands during their first year at sea. The young albatrosses covered an average distance of 184,000 km during the first year, restricting their dispersal movement to the unproductive and low wind subtropical Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea. The juveniles initiated the migration by an innate phase of rapid dispersal encoded as a fixed flight direction assisted by southerly winds towards north and northeast. Thereafter each individual restricted its movement to a particular zone of the ocean that will possibly be used until they start breeding 7-10 years later and return in contact with breeding adults. This dispersal in young birds corresponds well with movements observed for adult non-breeding wandering albatrosses. The results show clearly an inherited ability to navigate back to already visited areas in young wandering albatrosses.

Feeding events on squids were not observed during trips when fishing vessels were photographed and seemed to be distributed randomly and sparsely. Thus, this study suggests that Laysan albatrosses found large, presumably post-spawning, squids opportunistically while they were traveling during daylight hours. Although we did not find cetaceans in our surface pictures, we could not rule out the possibility that birds fed on squids, especially fragmented specimens, in the regurgitates of cetaceans at depth. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combining animal-borne GPS- and camera-loggers on wide-ranging top predators for studying the distribution of little known deep-sea squids and their importance in the diet of marine top predators.",INTER-RESEARCH,MAR 29,2018,103354meps12482,"[Nishizawa, Bungo; Watanuki, Yutaka] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, 3-1-1 Minato, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan./[Sugawara, Takanori; Yoda, Ken] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan./[Young, Lindsay C.; Vanderwerf, Eric A.] Pacific Rim Conservat, 3038 Oahu Ave, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","Nishizawa, B (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, 3-1-1 Minato, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan.",10_3354_meps12482

seabirds","In long-lived species with delayed maturity, prebreeders are expected to gather information by visiting and sampling the quality of potential nesting areas (prospecting), before they choose where to breed. In most seabirds, this process is important because, once recruited, individuals generally remain sitefaithful throughout their long reproductive life. As many seabirds are believed to display low levels of natal dispersal, it is possible that natal philopatry is an obligate strategy for most individuals, with prospecting being a negligible activity during the prebreeding stage. Using ringing information and GPS technology, we tracked breeding adults and prebreeder black-browed albatrosses, Thalassarche melanophris, from a colony of the Falkland Islands, during the breeding season. Breeding adults rarely engaged in prospecting, whereas prebreeders showed a high propensity to visit other colonies. Most prebreeders started prospecting ashore when 4e5 years old and most of the younger individuals prospected more than one breeding colony, with some prospecting up to five colonies in just 9 days. Prospecting activity did not differ between males and females and rapidly declined as prebreeders aged, by which time individuals had probably already selected their future nesting site. Nestling body mass at 60 days of age and hatching date did not influence prospecting behaviour later in life. Prospecting was mostly directed at colonies within 10 km from the natal place, but occurred regularly up to 55e65 km. While distance from the natal place was a strong predictor of the probability of a colony being prospected, colony size and growth rate were not. Our results provide new insights into the role of prospecting in the process of recruitment, showing that even for highly philopatric birds, recruitment to the natal colony (or to another nesting site) has the potential to be informed, not done blindly.

While the availability of high resolution GPS data for both seabirds and vessels over the past few years has allowed analyses of fine-scale behavioural responses of seabirds near fishing vessels, little information is available on the distance at which seabirds respond to vessels. Indeed, previous studies have focused on the foraging behaviour of individuals within the vicinity of vessels but have not considered the approach phase of birds. Here we provide such an estimate by examining changes in the flight direction of GPS-tracked wandering albatrosses breeding on the Crozet Islands in response to the toothfish fishing fleet operating around the breeding grounds, monitored using GPS vessel monitoring system data. We show that although we detect increases in feeding behaviour only when albatrosses are within 3 km of boats, they display clear changes in flight direction, towards vessels, at distances up to 30 km. This distance is nearly 3 times as large as previous estimates, almost reaching the theoretical maximum visual range of an albatross. We discuss these results in the light of previous estimates, and pinpoint factors likely to affect the attraction distance. We suggest that this simple estimate of attraction distance could be investigated in other seabird-fishery systems, to improve our understanding of the factors affecting seabird interaction behaviour, and thus better predict when overlap will lead to interactions.",INTER-RESEARCH,APR 22,2015,103354meps11233,"[Collet, Julien; Patrick, Samantha C.; Weimerskirch, Henri] Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France./[Collet, Julien] Ecole Normale Super Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France./[Patrick, Samantha C.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.","Collet, J (reprint author), Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",10_3354_meps11233

While theoretically described, the effects in the aftermath of stress have thus far not been tested empirically. Here, we compared for the first time resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy volunteers before and after a mild social stressor. Following the theoretical prediction, we focused on connectivity of the salience network (SN), the executive control network (ECN) and the default mode network (DMN). The DMN exhibited increased resting-state functional connectivity following the cyberball task to the key nodes of the SN, namely the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula, as well as sensorimotor regions and higher-order visual areas. We conclude that this increased connectivity of the DMN with key nodes of the SN and regions responsible for preparatory motor activity and visual motion processing indicates a shift towards an 'alerted default mode' in the aftermath of stress. This brain response may be triggered or aggravated by (social) stress induced by the cyberball task, enabling individuals to better reorient attention, detect salient external stimuli, and deal with the emotional and affective consequences of stress.",NA,JAN 5,2017,101038srep40180,NA,NA,NA

They usually cause azimuth defocusing and phase errors. For very high-resolution SAR imaging and repeat-pass SAR interferometry, the RME must be estimated and compensated. In the literature, the algorithms used to estimate such errors are mainly through interferometry. The error difference for the SAR image pair is calculated, and then the correction is applied either on one image, or alternatively fractions of it on both images. However, the accuracy of this approach is greatly deteriorated by the decorrelation and ground movements. In this paper, we associate the phase difference between two adjacent subaperture images with the second derivative of the RME, and propose a new algorithm to estimate the RME for individual SAR image. It exploits point-like targets distributed along the azimuth direction, and not only corrects the phase error, but also improves the azimuth focusing. Therefore, besides in airborne repeat-pass interferometry, the algorithm can also be applied in very high-resolution SAR imaging. Simulated and real SAR data are used to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy.

A recent development-that of dead-reckoning-is being increasingly used to examine the fine-scale movement of animals underwater. The advantages and drawbacks of this approach are quite different to those incurred by the other methods. This paper considers the advances that dead-reckoning can bring to the study of the often cryptic movement and behaviour of marine animals at sea. Methods used in determining position via dead-reckoning are presented and consideration is given to results derived from the use of dead-reckoning on cetaceans, pinnipeds, penguins and sea turtles; these are complemented by data on cormorants and albatrosses acquired using GPS systems. Suggestions are made as to how movement data derived from these devices can be analysed using indices that allow interpretation over a large variety of temporal and spatial scales.

One-dimensional movement metrics scale consistently with body size yet vary over different temporal scales. Knowing how temporal scale influences the relationship between animal body size and movement would better inform hypotheses about the efficiency of foraging behaviour, the ontogeny of energy budgets, and numerous life-history trade-offs.
2. We investigated how the temporal scaling of allometric patterns in movement varies over the course of a year, specifically during periods of motivated (directional and fast movement) and unmotivated (stationary and tortuous movement) behaviour. We focused on a recently diverged group of species that displays wide variation in movement behaviour -giant Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) -to test how movement metrics estimated on a monthly basis scaled with body size.
3. We used state-space modelling to estimate seven different movement metrics of Galapagos tortoises. We used log-log regression of the power law to evaluate allometric scaling for these movement metrics and contrasted relationships by species and sex.
4. Allometric scaling of movement was more apparent during motivated periods of movement. During this period, allometry was revealed at multiple temporal intervals (hourly, daily and monthly), with values observed at daily and monthly intervals corresponding most closely to the expected one-fourth scaling coefficient, albeit with wide credible intervals. We further detected differences in the magnitude of scaling among taxa uncoupled from observed differences in the temporal structuring of their movement rates.
5. Our results indicate that the definition of temporal scales is fundamental to the detection of allometry of movement and should be given more attention in movement studies. Our approach not only provides new conceptual insights into temporal attributes in one-dimensional scaling of movement, but also generates valuable insights into the movement ecology of iconic yet poorly understood Galapagos giant tortoises.",WILEY,SEP,2016,1.01111136526561E+018,"[Bastille-Rousseau, Guillaume; Frair, Jacqueline L.; Blake, Stephen] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA./[Bastille-Rousseau, Guillaume; Frair, Jacqueline L.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Roosevelt Wild Life Stn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA./[Yackulic, Charles B.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA./[Cabrera, Freddy; Blake, Stephen] Charles Darwin Fdn, Isla Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador./[Blake, Stephen] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany./[Blake, Stephen] Univ Missouri, Whitney Harris World Ecol Ctr, St Louis, MO 63121 USA./[Blake, Stephen] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.","Bastille-Rousseau, G (reprint author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.; Bastille-Rousseau, G (reprint author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Roosevelt Wild Life Stn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",NA

To better understand the basis for the biophysical diversity of KCNQ1 channels, we here investigate the basis of KCNQ1 gating in the absence of beta subunits using voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF). In our previous study, we found the kinetics and voltage dependence of voltage-sensor movements are very similar to those of the channel gate, as if multiple voltage-sensor movements are not required to precede gate opening. Here, we have tested two different hypotheses to explain KCNQ1 gating: (i) KCNQ1 voltage sensors undergo a single concerted movement that leads to channel opening, or (ii) individual voltage-sensor movements lead to channel opening before all voltage sensors have moved. Here, we find that KCNQ1 voltage sensors move relatively independently, but that the channel can conduct before all voltage sensors have activated. We explore a KCNQ1 point mutation that causes some channels to transition to the open state even in the absence of voltage-sensor movement. To interpret these results, we adopt an allosteric gating scheme wherein KCNQ1 is able to transition to the open state after zero to four voltage-sensor movements. This model allows for widely varying gating behavior, depending on the relative strength of the opening transition, and suggests how KCNQ1 could be controlled by coassembly with different KCNE family members.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,MAY 1,2012,101073pnas1201582109,"[Osteen, Jeremiah D.; Robey, Seth; Sampson, Kevin J.; Kass, Robert S.] Columbia Univ, Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pharmacol, New York, NY 10032 USA./[Barro-Soria, Rene; Larsson, H.

To elucidate the effects of gravity on human physiology and behavior, we examined changes in wrist and trunk activities and heart rate during parabolic flight and the activity of wrist and trunk in water immersion experiments. Data from 195 person-time parabolas performed by eight subjects revealed that the trunk motion counts decreased by approximately half during ascending legs (hypergravity), relative to the data acquired before the parabolic flights. In contrast, the wrist activity remained unchanged. The results from the water immersion experiments demonstrated that in the underwater condition, both the wrist and trunk activities were significantly decreased but the latter decreased to a much lower level. Together, these data suggest that gravitational alterations can result in differential influences on the motions of the wrist and the trunk.

Koprowski, John L.",NA,NA,NA,"Natal dispersal outcomes are an interplay between environmental conditions and individual phenotypes. Peripheral, isolated populations may experience altered environmental conditions and natal dispersal patterns that differ from populations in contiguous landscapes. We document nonphilopatric, sex-biased natal dispersal in an endangered small mammal, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis), restricted to a single mountain. Other North American red squirrel populations are shown to have sex-unbiased, philopatric natal dispersal. We ask what environmental and intrinsic factors may be driving this atypical natal dispersal pattern. We test for the influence of proximate factors and ultimate drivers of natal dispersal: habitat fragmentation, local population density, individual behavior traits, inbreeding avoidance, competition for mates, and competition for resources, allowing us to better understand altered natal dispersal patterns at the periphery of a species' range. A juvenile squirrel's body condition and its mother's mass in spring (a reflection of her intrinsic quality and territory quality) contribute to individual behavioral tendencies for movement and exploration. Resources, behavior, and body condition have the strongest influence on natal dispersal distance, but affect males and females differently. Male natal dispersal distance is positively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and individual tendency for movement; female natal dispersal distance is negatively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and positively influenced by individual tendency for movement. An apparent feedback between environmental variables and subsequent juvenile behavioral state contributes to an altered natal dispersal pattern in a peripheral population, highlighting the importance of studying ecological processes at the both range center and periphery of species' distributions.",NA,JAN,2017,101002ece32612,NA,NA,10_1002_ece3_2612

Managed forests are a significant landscape component in the southern United States and provide opportunities for conservation alongside production of wood products. We investigated behavioral responses of rodents to differences in understory habitat characteristics from intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a native biofuel feedstock, in intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands. Previous research indicated that planting switchgrass increased rodent population abundance but reduced recruitment and community diversity. To understand potential mechanisms underlying our previous results, we measured behaviors of individual cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), a grassland specialist, to planted switchgrass. We hypothesized that female territory size, foraging activity, overlap with other adult females, and reproduction indices would differ among treatments (switchgrass monocrop, intercropped switchgrass, and control plots) due to variation in grass abundance and vertical vegetation cover. We conducted live-trapping, radio telemetry, and foraging activity surveys on cotton rats during summers of 2013-2015. We found no treatment effect on territory size, but foraging activity was 2 times higher in monocrop than control plots. We also found a positive relationship between female spatial overlap and percentage of grass in control plots and evidence for higher reproductive indices in control than monocrop plots. Our results suggest that cotton rats in monocrop plots exhibited unexpected behaviors, and monocrop plots may serve as population sinks with low rodent diversity.

Garter snakes near a communal overwintering den in Manitoba show courtship in two contexts: competition from rival males is intense close to the den, but weak or absent when males court solitary dispersing females in the surrounding woodland. Larger size enhances male mating success near the den, but not mate location rates in the woodland. As predicted by the hypothesis that males match their tactics to their competitive abilities, our mark-recapture data show that larger, heavier individuals remained near the den, whereas smaller and more emaciated males moved to the woodland. To locate mates, woodland males relied upon substrate-deposited pheromonal trails and visual cues (rapid movement), whereas males in the crowded den environment ignored such cues and instead tongue-flicked every snake they encountered to check for sex pheromones. In arena trials, den males adjusted their courtship intensity to the presence of rival males, whereas woodland males did not (perhaps reflecting the lower probability of interruption by a rival). Thus, male garter snakes adjust the times, places, form and intensity of their reproductive behaviours (mate-searching tactics, intensity of courtship) relative to both their own competitive abilities and spatial heterogeneity in mating opportunities.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,AUG,2005,101016janbehav200504001,"Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia./Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","Shine, R (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",NA

In Hawai?i, historical reports suggest that many Hawaiian honeycreepers such as the Iiwi (Drepanis coccinea) once undertook seasonal migrations, but the existence of such movements today is unclear. Because Hawaiian honeycreepers are highly susceptible to avian malaria, currently minimal in high-elevation forests, understanding the degree to which honeycreepers visit lower elevation forests may be critical to predict the current impact of malaria on population dynamics and how susceptible bird populations may respond to climate change and mitigation scenarios. Using radio telemetry data, we demonstrate for the first time that a large fraction of breeding adult and juvenile Iiwi originating from an upper-elevation (1,920m) population at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge exhibit post-breeding movements well below the upper elevational limit for mosquitoes. Bloom data suggest seasonal variation in floral resources is the primary driver of seasonal movement for Iiwi. To understand the demographic implications of such movement, we developed a spatial individual-based model calibrated using previously published and original data. ?Iiwi dynamics were simulated backward in time, to estimate population levels in the absence of avian malaria, and forward in time, to assess the impact of climate warming as well as two potential mitigation actions. Even in disease-free refuge' populations, we found that breeding densities failed to reach the estimated carrying capacity, suggesting the existence of a seasonal migration load as a result of travel to disease-prevalent areas. We predict that Iiwi may be on the verge of extinction in 2100, with the total number of pairs reaching only +/- 0.2-12.3% of the estimated pre-malaria density, based on an optimistic climate change scenario. The probability of extinction of Iiwi populations, as measured by population estimates for 2100, is strongly related to their estimated migration propensity. Long-term conservation strategies likely will require a multi-pronged response including a reduction of malaria threats, habitat restoration and continued landscape-level access to seasonally variable nectar resources.",WILEY,AUG,2017,101002ecm1253,"[Guillaumet, Alban] Univ Hawaii Hilo, Hawaii Cooperat Studies Unit, Hawaii Natl Pk, POB 44, Hilo, HI 96718 USA./[Kuntz, Wendy A.] Kapiolani Community Coll, Math & Sci Dept, Kalia 101,4303 Diamond Head Rd, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA./[Samuel, Michael D.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Madison, WI 53706 USA./[Paxton, Eben H.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, POB 44, Volcano, HI 96718 USA.","Guillaumet, A (reprint author), Univ Hawaii Hilo, Hawaii Cooperat Studies Unit, Hawaii Natl Pk, POB 44, Hilo, HI 96718 USA.",10_1002_ecm_1253

Despite its geographic and taxonomic ubiquity, there is relatively little information about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence altitudinal migratory behaviour. Without this information, it is difficult to predict how rapid environmental changes will affect population viability of altitudinal migrants. To synthesize current knowledge, we compiled literature on altitudinal migration for all studied taxa, and identified the leading hypotheses explaining this behaviour. Studies of animal altitudinal migration cover many taxonomic lineages, with birds being the most commonly studied group. Altitudinal migration occurs in all continents except for Antarctica, but about a third of the literature focused on altitudinal migration in North America. Most research suggests that food and weather are the primary extrinsic drivers of altitudinal migration. In addition, substantial individual-level variation in migratory propensity exists. Individual characteristics that are associated with sex, dominance rank, and body size explain much of the variation in migratory propensity in partially migratory populations, but individual-level correlates are poorly known for most taxa. More research is needed to quantify the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and climate change on altitudinal migrants. Demographic studies of individually marked populations would be particularly valuable for advancing knowledge of the cascading effects of environmental change on migratory propensity, movement patterns, and population viability. We conclude our review with recommendations for study designs and modelling approaches that could be used to narrow existing knowledge gaps, which currently hinder effective conservation of altitudinal migratory species.",WILEY,NOV,2018,101111brv12435,"[Hsiung, An C.; Cooper, Robert J.; Chandler, Richard B.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA./[Boyle, W.

Complex prey-processing behaviours have been thought to be lacking in fishes and other vertebrates, despite the fact that many of these animals feed on tough prey, like insects or even grasses. We investigated prey capture and processing in the insect-feeding freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro using high-speed videography. We find that Potamotrygon motoro uses asymmetrical motion of the jaws, effectively chewing, to dismantle insect prey. However, CT scanning suggests that this species has simple teeth. These findings suggest that in contrast to mammalian chewing, asymmetrical jaw action is sufficient for mastication in other vertebrates. We also determined that prey capture in these rays occurs through rapid uplift of the pectoral fins, sucking prey beneath the ray's body, thereby dissociating the jaws from a prey capture role. We suggest that the decoupling of prey capture and processing facilitated the evolution of a highly kinetic feeding apparatus in batoid fishes, giving these animals an ability to consume a wide variety of prey, including molluscs, fishes, aquatic insect larvae and crustaceans.

Technologies that assist the elderly in independent living are essential for enhancing care in a cost-effective and reliable manner. Elderly care applications often demand real-time observation of the environment and the resident's activities using an event-driven system. As an emerging area of research and development, it is necessary to explore the approaches of the elderly care system in the literature to identify current practices for future research directions. Therefore, this work is aimed at a comprehensive survey of non-wearable (i.e., ambient) sensors for various elderly care systems. This research work is an effort to obtain insight into different types of ambient-sensor-based elderly monitoring technologies in the home. With the aim of adopting these technologies, research works, and their outcomes are reported. Publications have been included in this survey if they reported mostly ambient sensor-based monitoring technologies that detect elderly events (e.g., activities of daily living and falls) with the aim of facilitating independent living. Mostly, different types of non-contact sensor technologies were identified, such as motion, pressure, video, object contact, and sound sensors. Besides, multicomponent technologies (i.e., combinations of ambient sensors with wearable sensors) and smart technologies were identified. In addition to room-mounted ambient sensors, sensors in robot-based elderly care works are also reported. Research that is related to the use of elderly behavior monitoring technologies is widespread, but it is still in its infancy and consists mostly of limited-scale studies. Elderly behavior monitoring technology is a promising field, especially for long-term elderly care. However, monitoring technologies should be taken to the next level with more detailed studies that evaluate and demonstrate their potential to contribute to prolonging the independent living of elderly people.",MDPI,JUL,2018,103390s18072027,"[Uddin, Md.

Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.
Objective
To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.
Methods
We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1 +/- 8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; <15 [reference category], 15-<30, >= 30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.
Results
After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta(eGFR) = 2.30 (95%CI= 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta(eGFR) =-0.71 (-1.08;-0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR15-<30mg/24h = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR >= 30mg/24h = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR15-<30 mg/24h = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR >= 30 mg/24h =1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.
Conclusions
Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 4,2018,101371journalpone0195306,"[Martens, Remy J.

horizontal beaming","Coastal and estuarine environments are particularly productive ecological systems and can provide protein and nutrient exports to adjacent marine ecosystems. In spite of this, studies of fish school migration patterns between lagoons and the sea are lacking. In 1999, fish samplings combining fishing and acoustic sonar field data collection were performed in two shallow water channel lagoons to monitor fish school diel migration (lagoon-sea). Lagoon fish assemblages included 15 species and 10 families. The estimated abundances and the fishes' swimming characteristics permit those detected by sonar to be selected according to 3 criteria. Direct sampling by cast net confirmed that Dicentrarchus labrax schools were present during the autumn migration period. In situ horizontal sonar observation in shallow water bodies constitutes a powerful tool for the Study of fish behaviour. Fish school migration within the range of values recorded was not affected by current velocity (maximum 0.83 m/s). No relationships among school shape, surface area or migratory direction were found. The amphidromous schools were small (0.3 to 15 in 2) and observed mainly at night. Migratory behaviour appeared to be determined to some extent by fluctuations in lagoon salinity and temperature. Consistent with the 'multi-transit' hypothesis, which states that schools pass several times in front of the sonar transducer before moving toward or away from the lagoon, the net flow of fish was less than that predicted by the sonar methodology. Thus the multi-transit behaviour hypothesis should be considered when interpreting fish Population transfer data gathered with acoustic methods using a single transducer in rivers, estuaries, or channels. In addition, the exclusive use of echosounder Could generate major biomass underestimation when the fish are grouped in schools. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that an 'I see you' signal has coevolved between the Asian hive bee, Apis cerana, and its hornet predator, Vespa velutina. When a hornet approaches a bee colony, guards perform a shaking movement that repels the hornet. To test whether this is an 'I see you' display, we exposed colonies to free-flying and tethered hornets and tethered butterflies. The intensity of the shaking was correlated with the hornet's proximity, whereas guard bees barely responded to a nonthreatening butterfly. The signal is likely to be honest, because the bees can kill the hornet by collective mobbing if it lands on the entrance. The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, which has not evolved in the presence of Asian hornets, does not produce the signal and is ineffective at killing hornets by collective mobbing. We also found that hornets were more successful at catching A. mellifera than A. cerana bees at the hive entrance. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

DAPHNIA - ITS USE IN UNDERSTANDING DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION",12553,"RINGELBERG, J",HYDROBIOLOGIA,NA,DAPHNIA; DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; MODEL; PHOTOTAXIS,"This preliminary mechanistic model of normal swimming and phototactic behaviour in individual Daphnia was constructed using data and assumptions based on experiments and observations. Swimming under constant light intensity is characterized by short periods of upward movements alternating with equal periods of downward movements. Two oscillators are proposed that generate these phases in swimming. Unexpected shifts in depth, as observed in D. magna and D. 'longispina', are also present in the swimming of the computer daphnid and thus seem to be inherent to the underlying mechanism. As in real daphnids, during relative decreases in light intensity of low velocity, positive phototactic upward swimming is stepwise. With increasing velocity in the change in light, these steps disappear. When the model is triggered by a natural increase in light at dawn, a small downward movement results. Migration distance can be increased to commonly found depths of migrating Daphnia by the introduction of a 'fish exudate factor' into the model, which enhances the phototactic response. Since attenuation of light in the water affects the phototactic swimming response, it also influences migration distance. The results of model calculations agree quite well with an empirical relationship between Secchi disc depth and amplitude of diel vertical migration in a number of lakes.",KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,JUL 7,1995,101007BF00032008,NA,"RINGELBERG, J (reprint author), UNIV AMSTERDAM,DEPT AQUAT ECOL,KRUISLAAN 320,1098 SM AMSTERDAM,NETHERLANDS.",NA

We present techniques, and their limits, incorporating a scientific echo sounder connected to a split-beam transducer to observe and characterise tuna aggregations around FADs, and propose a general approach for future studies. Experiments were conducted in French Polynesia between December 1995 and February 1997. Two methods, echo-counting and echo integration, were used. Echo-counting is possible when individual fish are sufficiently scattered so that each target can be discerned. On the other hand, echo integration can be used with both scattered and aggregated fish schools. The knowledge of tuna target strength is useful for separating targets for echo-counting, and essential for obtaining absolute estimates of densities by echo integration. Sonar performances and settings should be considered when choosing the most suitable method to determine fish density or assessing spatial structure of a tuna aggregation. These techniques allow one to study an entire tuna aggregation, its behaviour in space and time at very fine time-space scales (about a nautical mile and over a few hours), and open up a new scientific field to study the spatial structure and behaviour of tuna aggregations around anchored or drifting FADs.

Behavioural events that are important for understanding sociobiology and movement ecology are often rare, transient and localised, but can occur at spatially distant sites e.g. territorial incursions and co-locating individuals. Existing animal tracking technologies, capable of detecting such events, are limited by one or more of: battery life; data resolution; location accuracy; data security; ability to co-locate individuals both spatially and temporally. Technology that at least partly resolves these limitations would be advantageous. European badgers (Meles meles L.), present a challenging test-bed, with extra-group paternity (apparent from genotyping) contradicting established views on rigid group territoriality with little social-group mixing.
2. In a proof of concept study we assess the utility of a fully automated active-radio-frequency-identification (aRFID) system combining badger-borne aRFID-tags with static, wirelessly-networked, aRFID-detector base-stations to record badger co-locations at setts (burrows) and near notional border latrines. We summarise the time badgers spent co-locating within and between social-groups, applying network analysis to provide evidence of co-location based community structure, at both these scales.
3. The aRFID system co-located animals within 31.5m (adjustable) of base-stations. Efficient radio transmission between aRFIDs and base-stations enables a 20g tag to last for 2-5years (depending on transmission interval). Data security was high (data stored off tag), with remote access capability. Badgers spent most co-location time with members of their own social-groups at setts; remaining co-location time was divided evenly between intra- and inter-social-group co-locations near latrines and inter-social-group co-locations at setts. Network analysis showed that 20-100% of tracked badgers engaged in inter-social-group mixing per week, with evidence of trans-border super-groups, that is, badgers frequently transgressed notional territorial borders.
4. aRFID occupies a distinct niche amongst established tracking technologies. We validated the utility of aRFID to identify co-locations, social-structure and inter-group mixing within a wild badger population, leading us to refute the conventional view that badgers (social-groups) are territorial and to question management strategies, for controlling bovine TB, based on this model. Ultimately aRFID proved a versatile system capable of identifying social-structure at the landscape scale, operating for years and suitable for use with a range of species.",WILEY,DEC,2017,1011112041210X12839,"[Ellwood, Stephen A.; Newman, Chris; Montgomery, Robert A.; Buesching, Christina D.; Baker, Sandra E.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Abingdon, Oxon, England./[Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA./[Nicosia, Vincenzo; Latora, Vito] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Math Sci, London, England./[Markham, Andrew; Trigoni, Niki] Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Sensor Networks Grp, Oxford, England./[Mascolo, Cecilia; Pasztor, Bence] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge, England./[Dyo, Vladimir] Univ Bedfordshire, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Univ Sq, Luton, Beds, England.","Ellwood, SA (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Abingdon, Oxon, England.",10_1111_2041_210X_12839

However, wrist-worn activity monitoring is challenging due to the wide degree of freedom for the hand movements, as well as similarity of hand movements in different activities such as varying intensities of cycling. To strengthen the ability of wrist-worn sensors in detecting human activities more accurately, motion signals can be complemented by physiological signals such as optical heart rate (HR) based on photoplethysmography. In this paper, an activity monitoring framework using an optical HR sensor and a triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer is presented. We investigated a range of daily life activities including sitting, standing, household activities and stationary cycling with two intensities. A random forest (RF) classifier was exploited to detect these activities based on the wrist motions and optical HR. The highest overall accuracy of 89.6 +/- 3.9% was achieved with a forest of a size of 64 trees and 13-s signal segments with 90% overlap. Removing the HR-derived features decreased the classification accuracy of high-intensity cycling by almost 7%, but did not affect the classification accuracies of other activities. A feature reduction utilizing the feature importance scores of RF was also carried out and resulted in a shrunken feature set of only 21 features.

Few studies, however, have documented selection on behavioural responses that increase individual survival under human hunting pressure. Using habitat with dense concealing cover is a common strategy for risk avoidance, with a higher chance of survival being the payoff. At the same time, risk avoidance can be costly in terms of missed foraging opportunities. We investigated individual fine-scale use of habitat by 40 GPS-marked European red deer, Cervus elaphus, and linked this to their survival through the hunting season. Whereas all males used similar habitat in the days before the hunting season, the onset of hunting induced an immediate switch to habitat with more concealing cover in surviving males, but not in males that were later shot. This habitat switch also involved a trade-off with foraging opportunities on bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, a key forage plant in autumn. Moreover, deer that use safer forest habitat might survive better because they make safer choices in general. The lack of a corresponding pattern in females might be because females were already largely using cover when hunting started, as predicted by sexual segregation theory and the risk of losing offspring. The behavioural response of males to the onset of hunting appears to be adaptive, given that it is linked to increased survival, an important fitness component. We suggest that predictable harvesting regimes with high harvest rates could create a strong selective pressure for deer to respond dynamically to the temporal change in hunting risk. Management should consider the potential for both ecological and evolutionary consequences of harvesting regimes on behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In the population space, to improve searching ability of particles, iterative times and the fitness value of particles are regarded as factors to adaptively adjust the contraction-expansion coefficient of the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO). The improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IQPSO) can make particles adjust their behaviours according to their quality. In the belief space, a new update strategy is adopted to update cultural individuals according to the idea of the update strategy in shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). Moreover, to enhance the utilization of information in the population space and belief space, accept function and influence function are redesigned in the new communication protocol. The experimental results show that ACA-IQPSO can obtain good clustering centres according to the grey distribution information of underwater sonar images, and accurately complete underwater objects detection. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed ACA-IQPSO has good effectiveness, excellent adaptability, a powerful searching ability and high convergence efficiency. Meanwhile, the experimental results of the benchmark functions can further demonstrate that the proposed ACA-IQPSO has better searching ability, convergence efficiency and stability.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,DEC 18,2017,101038s41598017179453,"[Wang, Xingmei; Li, Qiming] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, 145 Nantong St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China./[Hao, Wenqian] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Acoust, Beijing 10080, Peoples R China.","Wang, XM (reprint author), Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, 145 Nantong St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",10_1038_s41598_017_17945_3

Adaptive interventions are dynamic; components or doses change in response to short-term variations in participant's performance. Emerging theory and technologies make adaptive goal setting and feedback interventions feasible.
Objective: To test an adaptive intervention for PA based on Operant and Behavior Economic principles and a percentile-based algorithm. The adaptive intervention was hypothesized to result in greater increases in steps per day than the static intervention.
Methods: Participants (N = 20) were randomized to one of two 6-month treatments: 1) static intervention (SI) or 2) adaptive intervention (AI). Inactive overweight adults (85% women, M=36.9+/-9.2 years, 35% non-white) in both groups received a pedometer, email and text message communication, brief health information, and biweekly motivational prompts. The AI group received daily step goals that adjusted up and down based on the percentile-rank algorithm and micro-incentives for goal attainment. This algorithm adjusted goals based on a moving window; an approach that responded to each individual's performance and ensured goals were always challenging but within participants' abilities. The SI group received a static 10,000 steps/day goal with incentives linked to uploading the pedometer's data.
Results: A random-effects repeated-measures model accounted for 180 repeated measures and autocorrelation. After adjusting for covariates, the treatment phase showed greater steps/day relative to the baseline phase (p<.001) and a group by study phase interaction was observed (p = .017). The SI group increased by 1,598 steps/day on average between baseline and treatment while the AI group increased by 2,728 steps/day on average between baseline and treatment; a significant between-group difference of 1,130 steps/day (Cohen's d = .74).
Conclusions: The adaptive intervention outperformed the static intervention for increasing PA. The adaptive goal and feedback algorithm is a ""behavior change technology"" that could be incorporated into mHealth technologies and scaled to reach large populations.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,DEC 9,2013,101371journalpone0082901,"[Adams, Marc A.; Hekler, Eric B.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Nutr & Hlth Promot, Phoenix, AZ USA./[Sallis, James F.; Norman, Gregory J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Family & Prevent Med, San Diego, CA 92103 USA./[Adams, Marc A.; Hovell, Melbourne F.] San Diego State Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, San Diego, CA 92182 USA./[Sallis, James F.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Psychol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA./[Perata, Elyse] Calif State Univ East Bay, Coll Educ & Allied Studies, Hayward, CA USA.","Adams, MA (reprint author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Nutr & Hlth Promot, Phoenix, AZ USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0082901

Commercially available tracking systems lack the data storage capacity needed to frequently collect animal location data (e.g., 15-minute intervals or less) over long-term deployment periods (e.g., 1 year or more). Some commercial systems have remote data-download capabilities, reducing the need to recapture tagged animals for data retrieval, but these systems download data via satellite (Argos), global system for mobile communications (GSM) cellular telephone, or telemetry radio frequencies. Satellite systems are excessively expensive, and GSM cellular coverage is extremely limited within the United States. Radio-based systems use narrow-band very-high- or ultra-high frequencies requiring the user to obtain frequency allocations. None of these existing systems were designed to provide continual, real-time data access. The Clark GPS Animal Tracking System (Clark ATS) was developed to meet the evolving demands of animal ethologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and livestock producers. The Clark ATS uses memory-card technology for expandable data storage from 16 megabytes to 8 gigabytes. Remote data downloading and program uploading is accomplished using spread-spectrum radio transceivers, which do not require narrow-band radio frequency allocations. These radios also transmit, at a user-defined time interval, a real-time, GPS-location beacon to any Clark ATS base station within range (about 24 km or 15 miles line of sight). Advances incorporated into the Clark ATS make it possible to evaluate animal behavior at very fine spatial- and temporal-resolution over long periods of time. The real-time monitoring provided by this system enables researchers to accurately examine animal distribution and activity responses to acute, short-term disturbances relative to longer-term behavioral patterns. The Clark ATS also provides a huge time- and cost-savings to researchers and natural resource managers attempting to relocate a tagged animal in the field for direct observation or other operations.",SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,MAY,2006,10211105162R1,"USDA ARS, NW Watershed Res Ctr, Boise, ID 83712 USA./Oregon State Univ, Dept Rangeland Ecol & Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA./Micron Technol Inc, Boise, ID 83716 USA./Hewlett Packard Corp, Boise, ID 83714 USA./Boise State Univ, Boise, ID 83725 USA.","Clark, PE (reprint author), USDA ARS, NW Watershed Res Ctr, 800 Pk Blvd,Suite 105, Boise, ID 83712 USA.",NA
"An agent-based modeling approach to represent infestation dynamics of
the emerald ash borer beetle",3846,"Anderson, Taylor
Dragicevic, Suzana",NA,NA,NA,"Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up approach capable of operationalizing complex systems. The approach can be used to reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns in ecological processes such as insect infestation by representing individual dynamics and interactions between ""agents"" and their environment from which complex behavior emerges. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is an invasive species native to southeast Asia which has infested and killed millions of ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) across the eastern United States as well as Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Efforts to model the insect's behavior are ongoing, but current models are limited to approaches that do not address the complexity that emerges from the dynamics between individual beetles and their varying spatial environments. The objective of this study is to develop an ABM to represent the interactions of the EAB and the emerging spatio-temporal pattern of the insect spread. The model is implemented on real datasets from the Town of Oakville, Ontario, Canada from 2008 to 2010. Tree inventory and land use data acquired from the Town of Oakville were used to represent the spatial environment of the EAB agents. The EAB interactions are implemented in the model as subroutines, each representing a stage in the EAB life cycle using a temporal resolution of one day. Model verification was performed based on the literature documenting the life cycle processes of the EAB to represent EAB behavior. The model is calibrated using the rate of spread observed in the Town of Oakville from 2008 to 2009 and is validated using datasets delimiting the spatial extent and severity of EAB infestation in 2009. When comparing simulated and observed data, there is a 72% agreement for the locations of the infestation. This indicates that the developed ABM approach offers a model able to capture the complex behavior of EAB where both the spatial extent and severity of infestation are simulated realistically. The model generates insights about the underlying processes governing EAB behavior, highlights areas of uncertainty in modeling the complex spatio-temporal patterns of EAB infestation, and is a useful tool for forest and pest management.

We evaluated the accuracy and precision of geolocation positions by comparing these locations with satellite data from Service Argos for eight free-ranging gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) equipped with both a satellite-linked data recorder (SDR) and a GLTDR. Geolocation positions differed by 1,026.0 +/- 292.28 km from the corresponding Argos locations. We developed an algorithm to correct geolocation positions by comparing surface water temperature (ST) and dive depth collected by GLTDRs with existing sea-surface temperature and bathymetry databases. The corrected positions were significantly closer (P < 0.025) to the Argos locations of these seals (94.2 +/- 8.22 km).

Considered a pest by some and a resource by others, its rapid increase in population and distribution has raised management concerns. Studies on activity rhythms may provide useful insights into its overall ecology and help develop effective management strategies. By examining highly detailed activity data collected by means of accelerometers fitted on GPS-collars, we studied wild boar daily activity rhythms and the effect of environmental conditions on their diurnal and nocturnal activity. We thus provided evidence of the predominantly nocturnal and monophasic activity of wild boars. All year round, we reported low activity levels during the day, which opportunistically increased under the most favourable environmental conditions. Activity was found to be significantly affected by such weather conditions as temperature, precipitation and air relative humidity. Moreover, we found that nocturnal activity slightly increased as moonlight increased. Part of our analysis was focused on the hunting period in order to investigate whether wild boars modify their activity levels in response to hunting disturbance. Our results suggested that wild boar nocturnal habits are not directly influenced by the current hunting disturbance, though we hypothesised that they may have evolved over several decades of hunting harassment. Alternatively, but not exclusively, nocturnal habits may have evolved as a low-cost strategy to achieve an optimum thermal balance (i.e., behavioural thermoregulation).

However, some predictive devices are not easily worn by elderly people. In this work, a huge dataset, including 2520 tests, is employed to determine the best sensor placement location on the body and to reduce the number of sensor nodes for device ergonomics. During the tests, the volunteer's movements are recorded with six groups of sensors each with a triaxial (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) sensor, which is placed tightly on different parts of the body with special straps: head, chest, waist, right-wrist, right-thigh and right-ankle. The accuracy of individual sensor groups with their location is investigated with six machine learning techniques, namely the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, Bayesian decision making (BDM), support vector machines (SVM), least squares method (LSM), dynamic time warping (DTW) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each technique is applied to single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple sensor configurations. These configurations create 63 different combinations, and for six machine learning techniques, a total of 63 x 6 = 378 combinations is investigated. As a result, the waist region is found to be the most suitable location for sensor placement on the body with 99.96% fall detection sensitivity by using the k-NN classifier, whereas the best sensitivity achieved by the wrist sensor is 97.37%, despite this location being highly preferred for today's wearable applications.",MDPI AG,AUG,2016,103390s16081161,"[Ozdemir, Ahmet Turan] Erciyes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.","Ozdemir, AT (reprint author), Erciyes Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-38039 Kayseri, Turkey.",5017327

Satellite telemetry enables researchers to track individual movements, but population level inferences are rare due to data limitations that result from difficulty of capture and sporadic tag reporting. We introduce a Bayesian modeling framework to address population level questions with satellite telemetry data when data are sparse. We also outline an approach for identifying informative variables for use within the model. We tested our modeling approach using a large telemetry dataset for Shortfin Makos (Isurus oxyrinchus), which allowed us to assess the effects of various degrees of data paucity. First, a permuted Random Forest analysis is implemented to determine which variables are most informative. Next, a generalized additive mixed model is used to help define the relationship of each remaining variable with the response variable. Using jags and rjags for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we then developed a movement model to generate parameter estimates for each of the variables of interest. By randomly reducing the tagging dataset by 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent and recalculating the parameter estimates, we demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian approach can be applied in data-limited situations. We also demonstrate how two commonly used linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be similarly applied. Additionally, we simulate data from known parameter values to test each model's ability to recapture those values. Despite performing similarly, we advocate using the Bayesian over the MLE approach due to the ability for later studies to easily utilize results of past study to inform working models, and the ability to use prior knowledge via informed priors in systems where such information is available.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,NOV 28,2017,101371journalpone0188660,"[Kinney, Michael J.; Kacev, David] NOAA, Ocean Associates, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, San Diego, CA 92127 USA./[Kohin, Suzanne; Eguchi, Tomoharu] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, San Diego, CA USA.","Kinney, MJ (reprint author), NOAA, Ocean Associates, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, San Diego, CA 92127 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0188660

Nielsen, Julie K.
Seitz, Andrew C.",NA,NA,NA,"Correspondence between patterns of occupied depth and environmental cycles, called ""depth-specific periodic behavior"", has been used to inform management of several flatfishes. However, little is known about depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), an important species in recreational, commercial and subsistence fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. To evaluate depth-specific periodic behavior of Pacific halibut, an approach was developed in which depth data from electronic tags were used to produce four types of complementary plots, including two-dimensional time series of depth, activity level derived from differencing adjacent depth recordings, periodograms, and wavelet transform coefficients. From a visual examination of the plots, daily depth-specific periodic behavior types, including diel, tidal, spawning, semi-lunar and lunar, were assigned to 37 individual Pacific halibut. Overall, the approach used in this study was useful for describing relatively short term depth-specific periodic behavior, but was less informative for understanding relatively long term behavioral patterns. The results suggest that patterns in occupied depth may be related to seasonal activities of Pacific halibut. Specifically, during the summer feeding season, fish most commonly behaved periodically on a diel scale or inactively laid on the seafloor, which was manifested as tidal periodicity as the height of the water column fluctuated above the fish. Both active swimming and inactivity on the seafloor may be related to different foraging strategies. During fall and spring migratory periods and the winter spawning season, no periodicity in depth-specific behavior was most common, which may correspond to directed movement over irregular bathymetry between feeding and spawning locations or to reproductive behaviors. Evidence of an additional reproductive behavior, spawning rises off the seafioor, was also observed during the winter spawning season. This approach for understanding the periodicity of occupied depth of Pacific halibut provides additional insight into the behavior of this iconic species. This knowledge perhaps may be used in the future to inform this species' management, such as refining estimates of susceptibility to capture and examining timing of movement among regulatory areas.

In response, coastal fishes, including flatfishes, make extensive migrations that are roughly delineated by the seasonal progression of tolerable isotherms. In addition to changing adult distribution, migrations affect the placement of progeny relative to highly dynamic oceanographic features with a potential for strong consequence to their recruitment success. Annual and interannual migration patterns are poorly understood for even some of the most ecologically and economically important species. In part, this is due to a lack of understanding of the variation in individual movement, whether migrants respond as a single population or as multiple contingents. The ability to monitor individual residency and movement is desirable for understanding coastal population structure. As a result of the above, our long-term goals are to determine (1) the patterns of timing, extent, and rates of migration, and (2) how these patterns are influenced by natural and anthropogenic variables.

Data obtained from these devices provide not only a time series of animal occurrence at acoustic receivers, but also a direct measure of animal activity, which can be used to quantify trends in activity states over time and in relation to exogenous factors. Here we used passive acoustic accelerometry to examine trends in the activity and swimming depth of eight juvenile sand tigers (Carcharias taurus) in Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury (PKD) Bay, Massachusetts, USA, a recently identified nursery area. We applied a novel geostatistical modeling approach that accounts for both latent spatial and individual variation to assess the effects of time of day, tidal stage, water temperature, and lunar phase on activity patterns at both a population- and individual-level. The best-fitting model indicated that juvenile sand tigers were more active and more likely to be detected at the surface at night and during the new moon; water temperature was also a predictor of surface activity. Collectively, our results confirm conventional wisdom that sand tigers are slow-moving fish that are more active at night and provide evidence that high activity in PKD Bay may be indicative of foraging activity.",SPRINGER,DEC,2018,101007s1064101808214,"[Kneebone, Jeff] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA 02110 USA./[Winton, Megan] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Fisheries Oceanog, 836 South Rodney French Blvd, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA./[Danylchuk, Andy] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way,Room 311, Amherst, MA 01003 USA./[Chisholm, John; Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Marine Fisheries, 836 South Rodney French Blvd, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.","Kneebone, J (reprint author), New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA 02110 USA.",10_1007_s10641_018_0821_4

Mobile telemetry and a fixed telemetry system were used to record fish positions and to monitor 23 acoustically tagged individuals (17 females and six males) during the 2001 and 2002 reproductive seasons. Allis shad showed considerable exploratory behaviour, and a rest area was observed 1.5 km downstream of the spawning ground. Thirteen individuals were observed on the spawning area, though both males and females spent most of their time (70-99%) away from it. Male and female residency times on the spawning area were, respectively, 1-11 days and 1-7 days, and females were observed during both day and night on the spawning ground. In 2002, an analysis of the 3D swimming behaviour on the spawning ground of six individuals allowed us to estimate the number of spawning events per fish. Males participated in more spawning acts (up to 60) than females (0-2). (C) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is evident in music performance, dance, and drill. Although repetition of equal time intervals (i.e. isochrony) is the central principle for such prediction, this simple information is used in a flexible and complex way that accommodates both multiples, subdivisions, and gradual changes of intervals. The scope of this flexibility remains largely uncharted, and the underlying mechanisms are a matter for speculation. Here I report an auditory illusion that highlights some aspects of this behaviour and that provides a powerful tool for its future study. A sound pattern is described that affords multiple alternative and concurrent rates of recurrence (temporal levels). An algorithm that systematically controls time intervals and the relative loudness among these levels creates an illusion that the perceived rate speeds up or slows down infinitely. Human participants synchronised hand movements with their perceived rate of events, and exhibited a change in their movement rate that was several times larger than the physical change in the sound pattern. The illusion demonstrates the duality between the external signal and the internal predictive process, such that people's tendency to follow their own subjective pulse overrides the overall properties of the stimulus pattern. Furthermore, accurate synchronisation with sounds separated by more than 8 s demonstrate that multiple temporal levels are employed for facilitating temporal organisation and integration by the human brain. A number of applications of the illusion and the stimulus pattern are suggested.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,DEC 3,2009,101371journalpone0008151,"Umea Univ, Dept Psychol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.","Madison, G (reprint author), Umea Univ, Dept Psychol, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",10_1371_journal_pone_0008151

Prior to applying the sparse recovery technique, preprocessing procedures are performed for the minimization of the translational-motion-induced Doppler effects. Due to the imperfection of coarse motion compensation, the autofocus technique is further required to eliminate the residual phase errors. This paper considers the phase error correction problem in the context of the sparse signal recovery technique. In order to encode sparsity, a multitask Bayesian model is utilized to probabilistically formulate this problem in a hierarchical manner. In this novel method, a focused high-resolution radar image is obtained by estimating the sparse scattering coefficients and phase errors in individual and global stages, respectively, to statistically make use of the sparsity. The superiority of this algorithm is that the uncertainty information of the estimation can be properly incorporated to obtain enhanced estimation accuracy. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieves guaranteed convergence and avoids a tedious parameter-tuning procedure. Experimental results based on synthetic and practical data have demonstrated that our method has a desirable denoising capability and can produce a relatively well-focused image of the target, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio and high undersampling ratio scenarios, compared with other recently reported methods.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,OCT,2014,101109TGRS20132296497,"[Zhao, Lifan; Wang, Lu; Bi, Guoan; Yang, Lei] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.","Zhao, LF (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",NA

Digital sensor technologies offer improvements in naturalistic movement measurement and analysis. We conducted validity and feasibility testing of a real-time, indoor mapping and location system (Ubisense, Inc.) within a preschool classroom. Real-time indoor mapping has several implications with respect to efficiently and conveniently: (a) determining the activity areas where children are spending the most and least time per day (e.g., music); and (b) mapping a focal child's atypical real-time movements (e.g., lapping behavior). We calibrated the accuracy of Ubisense point-by-point location estimates (i.e., X and Y coordinates) against laser rangefinder measurements using several stationary points and atypical movement patterns as reference standards. Our results indicate that activity areas occupied and atypical movement patterns could be plotted with an accuracy of 30.48 cm (1 ft) using a Ubisense transponder tag attached to the participating child's shirt. The accuracy parallels findings of other researchers employing Ubisense to study atypical movement patterns in individuals at risk for dementia in an assisted living facility. The feasibility of Ubisense was tested in an approximately 90-min assessment of two children, one typically developing and one with Down syndrome, during natural classroom activities, and the results proved positive.

Their willingness to visit artificial feeders renders many species amenable to controlled experiments using mechanical ""flowers"" that replenish nectar automatically. However, the structural complexity of such feeders and the lack of a device for tracking the movements of multiple individuals have limited our ability to ask some specific questions related to natural foraging contexts, especially in competitive situations. To overcome such difficulties, we developed an experimental system for producing computer records of multiple foragers harvesting from simple artificial flowers with known rates of nectar secretion, using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to identify individual animals. By using infrared detectors (light-emitting diodes and phototransistors) to activate the RFID readers momentarily when needed, our system prevents the RFID chips from heating up and disturbing the foraging behavior of focal animals. To demonstrate these advantages, we performed a preliminary experiment with a captive colony of bumble bees, Bombus impatiens. In the experiment, two bees were tagged with RFID chips (2.5 x 2.5 mm, manufactured by Hitachi-Maxell, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and allowed to forage on 16 artificial flowers arranged in a big flight cage. Using the resulting data set, we present details of how the bees increased their travel speed between flowers, while decreasing the average nectar crop per flower, as they gained experience. Our system provides a powerful tool to track the movement patterns, reward history, and long-term foraging performance of individual foragers at large spatial scales.",SPRINGER,APR,2010,101007s0026501009072,"[Ohashi, Kazuharu] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan./[Thomson, James D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.","Ohashi, K (reprint author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan.",10_1007_s00265_010_0907_2

The lying/standing sensor was suspended below the animal, whilst the walking sensor was fitted to the shin of the animal's foreleg. Both switches gave a digital-low output when vertical or near vertical and a digital-high output when more than 45 degrees from vertical. The lying/standing sensor was operated when the animal lay down and the walking sensor was operated by leg movement, and also by the animal lying down. The sensor outputs were connected to digital recorders mounted on the animals.
Sheep fitted with lying/standing recording equipment were observed every 5 min during daylight over 24 h. The index of concordance between the automatic and manual observations of lying/standing was 0.953.
Cattle and sheep, fitted with equipment to record walking, were filmed by video camera for at least 10 min each. The number of steps counted by observers of the video recordings were compared with results from the automatic system. Mean square prediction error (MSPE) analysis of the automatic-system results showed they had an error of 7.7% for both cattle and sheep. This error was a percentage of the mean of the actual observed results.
Cattle fitted with equipment to record lying/standing and walking were observed every 10 min during daylight over 24 h. The concordance between automatic and manual observations of lying/standing was 0.990 using the lying/standing sensor and 0.996 using the walking sensor. The presence or absence of walking behaviour was also noted and the concordance for the automatic system results with this was 0.96.

It is also a prerequisite for anticipating changes in fishermen's activity in reaction to management rules, economic context, or evolution of exploited resources. Analyzing the trajectories of individual vessels offers promising perspectives to describe the activity during fishing trips. A hidden Markov model with two behavioral states (steaming and fishing) is developed to infer the sequence of non-observed fishing vessel behavior along the vessel trajectory based on Global Positioning System (GPS) records. Conditionally to the behavior, vessel velocity is modeled with an autoregressive process. The model parameters and the sequence of hidden behavioral states are estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm, coupled with the Viterbi algorithm that captures the most credible joint sequence of hidden states. A simulation approach was performed to assess the influence of contrast between the model parameters and of the path length on the estimation performances. The model was then fitted to four original GPS tracks recorded with a time step of 15min derived from volunteer fishing vessels operating in the Channel within the IFREMER RECOPESCA project. Results showed that the fishing activity performed influenced the estimates of the velocity process parameters. Results also suggested future inclusion of variables such as tide currents within the ecosystem approach of fisheries.

Yet, no direct link has been established between habitat change due to SLR and fish population production. Here we take a coupled modeling approach to examine the SLR-habitat-fish relationship based on projections of habitat change resulting from a 0.26 m increase in sea level by 2100 as input for a spatially-explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) of juvenile fish growth and mortality. This coupled modeling approach allows for an examination of both mechanistic and behavioral responses to habitat change, as well as the projected impact of these responses on population production. Habitat changes described with the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM 6.0.1) in response to SLR included a conversion of marsh and higher elevation habitat types into other structural types and open water, and an increase in overall fragmentation. These habitat changes were combined with measures of temporal change in dynamic habitat variables to form a habitat mosaic. The impact of changes in this mosaic on juvenile fish growth and mortality was largely dependent on movement strategy employed in the SEIBM followed by changes in dynamic habitat, and then changes in structural habitat projected by the SLAMM model. Movement strategy and SLR effects interacted strongly, which suggests that how fish respond to habitat change is a critical factor to understanding population-level effects. Overall, projected SLR effects on fish distribution most consistent with field data were initially negative for net fish production, but became net positive by the terminal year of SLR as the positive effects of fragmentation became most important. These results are consistent with empirical studies of coastal marsh production in the Gulf of Mexico and demonstrate the importance of incorporating a holistic measure of habitat quality and fish behavioral responses into any projection of SLR effects on estuarine fish production.

This question is becoming important in the context of the growing use of reward-based location-based service (LBS) applications, which aim to promote employee training activities and to share such data with insurance companies in order to reduce the healthcare insurance costs of an organization. One of the main concerns of such applications is the privacy of user trajectories, because the applications normally collect user locations over time with identities. The leak of the identified trajectories often results in personal privacy breaches. For instance, a trajectory would expose user interest in places and behaviors in time by inference and linking attacks. This information can be used for spam advertisements or individual-based assaults. To the best of our knowledge, no existing studies can be directly applied to solve the problem while keeping data utility. In this paper, we identify the personal privacy problem in a reward-based LBS application and propose privacy architecture with a bounded perturbation technique to protect user's trajectory from the privacy breaches. Bounded perturbation uses global location set (GLS) to anonymize the trajectory data. In addition, the bounded perturbation will not generate any visiting points that are not possible to visit in real time. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed bounded perturbation can effectively anonymize location information while preserving data utility compared to the existing methods.",MDPI,FEB,2018,103390ijgi7020053,"[Hasan, A.

One clear example of this is the collective motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to experimental data.
2. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each case.
3. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level repeatability of the underlying traits.
4. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals. Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments, and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence social behaviour.",WILEY,DEC,2017,1011112041210X12813,"[Szorkovszky, Alex; Sumpter, David J.

Historically, it has been difficult to quantify movement patterns of most fishes, but technological advances in acoustic telemetry have increased our abilities to monitor their movement. In this study, we combined small-scale active acoustic tracking with large-scale passive acoustic monitoring to develop an empirical movement model for sixgill sharks in Puget Sound, WA, USA. We began by testing whether a correlated random walk model described the daily movement of sixgills; however, the model failed to capture home-ranging behavior. We added this behavior and used the resultant model (a biased random walk model) to determine whether daily movement patterns are able to explain large-scale seasonal movement. The daily model did not explain the larger-scale patterns of movement observed in the passive monitoring data. In order to create the large-scale patterns, sixgills must have performed behaviors (large, fast directed movements) that were unobserved during small-scale active tracking. In addition, seasonal shifts in location were not captured by the daily model. We added these 'unobserved' behaviors to the model and were able to capture large-scale seasonal movement of sixgill sharks over 150 days. The development of empirical models of movement allows researchers to develop hypotheses and test mechanisms responsible for a species movement behavior and spatial distribution.

Males were observed in one of four treatments: solitary, socially with a male conspecific, socially with a female conspecific, or with a model of an avian predator. We identified 32 different types of behaviour, including postures and simple movements. Six of the behaviours (dorsolateral orientation, head bob, letisimulation, slow motion, throat flash and tail wave) are of particular interest because their functions are either controversial or unknown. We describe them in detail, and infer their functional significance from the contexts in which they occurred. Dorsolateral orientation and slow motion behaviours appear to function primarily in courtship; throat flashes may provide information to conspecifics; and letisimulation may function as an antipredator behaviour. The function of head bobs remains unresolved, and tail waves appear to signal residency, but need further investigation. Although the behaviours exhibited by C. jarnoldae males were generally similar to those reported in other skinks, two of the behaviours we observed (letisimulation and throat flash) have not previously been recorded in a skink.

In this study, we evaluated the behavioral classification accuracy of a Bayesian state-space model in Pacific walruses using Argos satellite tags with sensors to detect animal behavior in real time. We fit a two-state discrete-time continuous-space Bayesian state-space model to data from 306 Pacific walruses tagged in the Chukchi Sea. We matched predicted locations and behaviors from the state-space model (resident, transient behavior) to true animal behavior (foraging, swimming, hauled out) and evaluated classification accuracy with kappa statistics (kappa) and root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, we compared biased random bridge utilization distributions generated with resident behavior locations to true foraging behavior locations to evaluate differences in space use patterns. Results indicated that the two-state model fairly classified true animal behavior (0.06 <= kappa <= 0.26, 0.49 <= RMSE <= 0.59). Kernel overlap metrics indicated utilization distributions generated with resident behavior locations were generally smaller than utilization distributions generated with true foraging behavior locations. Consequently, we encourage researchers to carefully examine parameters and priors associated with behaviors in state-space models, and reconcile these parameters with the study species and its expected behaviors.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,OCT,2016,101111mms12332,"[Beatty, William S.; Jay, Chadwick V.; Fischbach, Anthony S.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.","Beatty, WS (reprint author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",NA

If, as will commonly be true, the time taken to join another individual on a patch increases with the distance to that patch, then we would expect foragers to be selective in accepting joining opportunities: preferentially joining nearby discoveries. If competition occurs on patches, then the profitability of joining (and of not joining) will be influenced by the strategies adopted by others. Here we present a series of models designed to illuminate the evolutionarily stable joining strategy. We confirm rigorously the previous suggestion that there should be a critical joining distance, with all joining opportunities within that distance being accepted and all others being declined. Further, we predict that this distance should be unaffected by the total availability of food in the environment, but should increase with decreasing density of other foragers, increasing speed of movement towards joining opportunities, increased difficulty in finding undiscovered food patches, and decreasing speed with which discovered patches can be harvested. We are further able to make predictions as to how fully discovered patches should be exploited before being abandoned as unprofitable, with discovered patches being more heavily exploited when patches are hard to find: patches can be searched for remaining food more quickly, forager density is low, and foragers are relatively slow in traveling to discovered patches.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,SEP-OCT,2005,101093behecoari063,"Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland./Univ Sussex, Dept Math, Ctr Stat & Stochast Modelling, Brighton BN1 9RF, E Sussex, England.","Ruxton, GD (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",NA

The searcher's path was recorded by a Global Positioning System (GPS) device attached to the child's waist. Participants were not rewarded nor their performance rated. Variation in the conspicuity of the targets influenced search performance as expected; cryptic targets resulted in slower searches and longer, more tortuous paths. Extracting the main features of the paths showed that the children: (1) paid little attention to the spatial distribution and at least in the conspicuous condition approximately followed a nearest neighbor pattern of target collection, (2) were strongly influenced by the conspicuity of the targets. We implemented a simple statistical model for the search rules mimicking the children's behavior at the level of individual (coarsened) steps.

For both species, streams are required resources, forest is a potential resource, and pasture is neutral habitat. Experimental manipulations were conducted at a spatial scale approaching typical inter-stream distances within our study region. A portion of the individuals was displaced away from its required stream habitat within its native landscape, and the remaining individuals were transferred to another landscape of alternate habitat structure (either forest or pasture). Within each habitat type we equate relative movement ability, an essential component of landscape connectivity, with the proportion of displaced individuals observed to have reached the stream, as measured against reobservation rates of control individuals released at the stream. We found that C. maculata, the species more consistent in its use of forest as a resource, moved significantly more readily through 700 m of pasture habitat than through the same distance of forest, while C. aequabilis moved with equal abilities through both habitat types. Historical behavior - whether or not the individuals typically used forest as a resource before the manipulations - did not have a statistically significant effect on the movement abilities of individuals of either species in either habitat type. There was, however, some evidence that C. maculata individuals native to non-forested landscapes moved more readily through forest than their forest-inhabiting counterparts. Both sexes moved with equal abilities irrespective of habitat type, but male C. aequabilis moved with greater ability through forest than females, while the reverse was true within pasture landscapes.",MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,OCT,1998,1023073546558,"Acadia Univ, Atlantic Cooperat Wildlife Ecol Res Network, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada.","Taylor, PD (reprint author), Acadia Univ, Atlantic Cooperat Wildlife Ecol Res Network, Dept Biol, Wolfville, NS B0P 1X0, Canada.",NA

Because migratory stopover accounts for the majority of time spent on migration, how individuals respond to both exogenous and endogenous factors associated with stopover will influence the pace of migration and arrival timing on the breeding grounds. Among the most important endogenous factors, body condition (i.e. fat stores) is expected to influence both movement behavior and departure decisions of individual migrants during stopover. In a novel experiment, we manipulated the condition of after-second-year (adult) male American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured during spring migratory stopover and radio-tracked all individuals after release using a passive automated telemetry array and conventional hand tracking. After accounting for the positive effect of tailwind and capture date on departure probability, we demonstrated that body condition influenced both the movement behavior of individuals and stopover duration. Individual movement decreased throughout the stopover period at a rate of 0.7 km day(-1), supporting the notion that birds progressively limit their movements as stopover progresses. However, treatment birds whose condition was experimentally reduced (i.e. food-restricted) exhibited similar to 3.4 times greater daily movement rates, and control birds were 4 times more likely to depart on a given day than treatment birds. These results underscore the importance of energetic condition in mediating the movement and stopover dynamics of migratory birds. Further, despite their capacity to make behavioral adjustments, our results suggest migratory songbirds that experience decreases in body condition during migration (which could result from inclement weather or low-quality stopover habitat) are likely to be delayed in their arrival on the breeding grounds, which could lower reproductive performance and ultimately have population-level ramifications.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JAN,2018,101642AUK17671,"[Dossman, Bryant C.; Matthews, Stephen N.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA./[Rodewald, Paul G.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY USA./[Dossman, Bryant C.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.","Dossman, BC (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.; Dossman, BC (reprint author), Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",NA

Larval amphibians-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), and American toad (Bufo americanus)-were added to artificial pools in four dispersal arrays on forest edges. Each array consisted of a pool surrounded by a circular drift fence with pitfall traps and two 2.5 x 50 m enclosures (runs) extending into forest and old-field habitat. Juveniles captured at the circular fences were individually marked and released into either field or forest runs. We determined initial distance, initial rate, total distance, and net distance moved by juveniles in the field versus forest from recaptures in the runs. We also conducted 24-hour dehydration trials to compare the rates of evaporative water loss by spotted and small-mouthed salamanders in field and forest. Initial orientation of spotted salamanders and toads was significantly biased toward forest. Orientation of small-mouthed salamanders did not differ significantly from random expectations. The avoidance of open-canopy habitat by juvenile American toads in particular indicates that predictions of dispersal behavior based on adult habitat use may be misleading. Spotted salamanders moved almost four times farther and toads more than three times farther into the forest than into the field, and recapture rates of both species were much lower in the field. We attribute the lower recapture rates and shorter distances moved in the field to higher mortality due to desiccation or an abundance of predators. Juvenile spotted and small-mouthed salamanders experienced greater evaporative water loss in the field. Our data on movement behavior and dehydration rates suggest that old-field habitats offer greater landscape resistance to dispersing juveniles of some species. Thus, forest fragmentation is likely to reduce dispersal rates between local populations of these three species, with potentially negative consequences for population persistence in altered landscapes.",BLACKWELL PUBLISHING INC,OCT,2002,101046j15231739200201085x,"Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.","Rothermel, BB (reprint author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, 105 Tucker Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",NA

The purpose of this study is to develop an animal model which is similar to human vasovagal syncope and establish an awake animal model of vasovagal syncope. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS). Blood pressure, heart rate, and cerebral blood flow were monitored before, during, and post-stimulation. sGVS resulted in hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased cerebral blood flow. One cohort of animals was subjected to sGVS while freely moving. sGVS in awake animals produced vasovagal syncope-like symptoms, including fatigue and uncoordinated movements; two animals experienced spontaneous falling. Another cohort of animals was preconditioned with isoflurane for several days before being subjected to sGVS. Isoflurane preconditioning before sGVS did not prevent sGVS-induced hypotension or bradycardia, yet isoflurane preconditioning attenuated sGVS-induced cerebral blood flow reduction. The sGVS rat model mimics elements of human vasovagal syncope pathophysiology (hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased cerebral perfusion), including behavioral symptoms such as fatigue and altered balance. This study indicates that the sGVS rat model is similar to human vasovagal syncope and that therapies directed at preventing cerebral hypoperfusion may decrease syncopal episodes and reduce injuries from syncopal falls.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SEP 22,2016,101371journalpone0163280,"[McBride, Devin W.; Klebe, Damon W.; Zhang, John H.; Tang, Jiping] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA./[Reis, Cesar; Applegate, Richard, II] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA./[Zhang, John H.] Loma Linda Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA./[Frank, Ethan] Loma Linda Univ, Sch Med, Loma Linda, CA USA.","Tang, JP (reprint author), Loma Linda Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Loma Linda, CA 92350 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0163280

A crucial, but questionable criterion of such migration research is assuming that effects of tracking devices on animal behaviour are negligible, to ensure results of tracking studies are biologically relevant. To address this concern, we experimentally quantified effects of a 2 g (ca. 1.1% of body mass) geolocation device on crested auklet (Aethia cristatella) behaviour, including return rate, activity on the colony surface, and measures of reproductive performance in a two-year, two-part field study. In experiment 1, we fitted tracking devices (or identical dummy devices) to one mate of a breeding pair in nesting crevices, to quantify effects on reproductive performance and nest fidelity. In experiment 2, we assigned dummy devices to birds captured at the colony site surface, to quantify effects on social activity, return rate and provisioning behaviour. For birds tagged in crevices, we detected no effect on fledging success, or chick growth rate (mass and wing length). However, mass at fledging age of chicks provisioned with one tagged parent was significantly lower than control, and low nest site fidelity (compared to control birds) was observed for tagged birds. Individuals tagged on the colony surface showed significantly reduced colony surface activity, return rates and provisioning behaviour. This study shows strong 'observer effects' of an attached device well below the recommended size limit for wildlife tagging. Future studies should both quantify effects of attached devices and consider the biological relevance of measures of the behaviour of interest.",BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,NA,2014,1011631568539X00003217,"[Robinson, Jill L.; Jones, Ian Lawrence] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada.","Robinson, JL (reprint author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada.",NA

However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e. g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse. ora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,APR,2008,1018900701641,"[Sillett, T.

Birds were released in dues (n=5) or in groups of six (n=5). One bird in each due or group was fitted with a radio transmitter. Although most translocated birds survived at least a month following translocation, they were not assimilated readily into resident populations of miners, but instead wandered much further (mean maximum distance from release site=4.2 km) than the average diameter of the species' home range (similar to 200 m). At least two of the 40 translocated birds returned to their capture site; a distance of 18 km. The distances travelled by radio-tagged birds from their release sites rendered invalid the assumption that one release group/duo did not influence how another group/duo behaved.

HS assessment is usually based on presence/absence data related to environmental variables. An exception is Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), which uses only presence data and which does not require absence data. Most HS modelling is based on input of all environmental parameters (EnvPs) without environmental categorization, and does not take into account species interaction and human intervention for an assessment of HS. In this study, the EnvPs are arranged into four features: geographical features, consumable features, human-factor features, and species-human interaction features. These features affect species with respect to movement, behavior and activity. The research presented here has used an already existing dataset of wildlife species and human activities/visitations, which was compiled during 2004-2006 in Phu-Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (PKWS). Data from 2004 to 2005 were used to produce HS maps, while the data of 2006 were used for evaluating these maps. Sambar Deer (SD) was chosen to predict its own HS. Six HS maps of SD were analyzed using ENFA in the following manner: (1) inputting all EnvPs together, (2) inputting each feature, separately and (3) integrating the four resulting HS maps by model averaging. It was found that model averaging was capable of predicting the HS of SD more reliably than the model with all EnvPs put in together. Multiple linear regressions were computed between the HS map with all EnvPs and the HS maps with each feature. The results show that the HS map with only geographical features has the highest coefficient value (0.516) while the coefficient values of other HS maps with the above features are 0.296, 0.53 and -0.006, respectively. This indicates that the geographical features have an influence on the other features and that the predicting power is lower when all EnvPs are computed in the ENFA model. Therefore, in order to generate HS, each feature should at first be put into the model separately. Following that, the average of all features will be combined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We will show that the newly developed DRVC test possesses two pronounced characteristics. The first characteristic is that the DRVC test incorporates such a priori knowledge that the radial velocities corresponding to the individual components of a moving target are all equal, while the second characteristic of the DRVC test is its clutter-heterogeneity-independent property. The two characteristics make the proposed detector a good candidate for addressing extremely heterogeneous environments.

We tested an individual-based method to discriminate active and passive behaviors on brown bears (Ursus arctos), using a dual-axis motion sensor mounted on Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile Communications (GPS-GSM) collars. The method takes into account individual variation in activity levels and does not require further calibration. We validated the method through direct observations of captive bears and an extensive survey of wild bear signs in the boreal forest of central Sweden. We found good correspondence between sensor-measured and observed activity on captive bears. Analysis of wild bear signs at GPS locations and its comparison with the collar-based activity status confirmed the possibility of successfully applying the method to study brown bear activity patterns in the wild. The method provided 94.3% correct activity classification on captive bears and about 78.2% on wild bears. We tested the possibility of using this technique to measure increasing levels of activity by analyzing the correlation between the collar-derived numeric activity and the intensity of bear movement. At a broader scale (active vs. passive), the sensor-measured value provided information on the degree of activity, but no correlation was evident at a finer scale (specific behaviors). We suggest that using more sensors in different regions of a bear's body could overcome this difficulty and improve our knowledge of animal behavior in the wild, through remote monitoring of activity levels. We conclude that this method can be useful in the study of behavioral ecology of a wide range of animals, especially species that are difficult to observe or move great distances.",WILDLIFE SOC,DEC,2006,102193009176482006341314AIMTMA20CO2,"Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Anim & Human Biol, I-00185 Rome, Italy./Scandinavian Brown Bear Res Project, I-3101030 Vasanello, VT, Italy./Scandinavian Brown Bear Res Project, SE-79498 Orsa, Sweden./Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway./Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway.","Gervasi, V (reprint author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Anim & Human Biol, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",NA

Since past attempts to rehabilitate the pike populations had only limited success, it is of importance to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of pike such that more effective restoration programs can be effectuated in the future. Ideally, this can be accomplished by relying on telemetry data, but since the collection of such data is both labour-intensive and costly, researchers often resort to a simulation-based approach, which on its turn requires a sound spatio-temporal model. Therefore, and as a first step towards an integrated individual-based model (IBM) for describing pike dynamics in rivers, an IBM mimicking the movement of pike in the river Yser, Belgium, is proposed in this paper. This model considers the specificities of pike, such as its seasonally dependent migration, swimming speed and habitat preference, and is based upon environmental data from the river Yser. It is shown that the in silico spatio-temporal dynamics coincides with the one that is typically inferred from in situ observations. Amongst other things, the proposed model may be relied upon to identify the most appropriate management and restoration measures through a scenario analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The parameters and procedures are based on observed behavior of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, during spring staging off the coast of Helgeland, Norway. Within a temporally and spatially heterogeneous environment, goose movement is modeled according to state-dependent site selection decisions that maximize food intake. The aim of each individual is to optimize fitness (survival and reproduction) by gaining enough food (energy reserves) during 3 weeks of foraging to meet a threshold of energy necessary for successful reproduction. The geese return to the same islands each year and oil a daily basis choose unoccupied sites according to their rank in the population-structured dominance hierarchy, memories of previously visited sites (tradition), past reproductive success, inherited genetic influence towards site faithfulness and/or site quality, and knowledge of the available biomass density. It is assumed that with each subsequent return to a specific location, increased familiarity of the area will benefit an individual through greater food acquisition by more efficient foraging practices. In the event of variable environmental conditions, geese are faced with a critical decision to return to previously visited sites or abandon tradition to explore for something better. It is shown that habitat quality plays an integral role in population dynamics. Beyond the scope of this paper, the evolution of foraging strategies that directly affect reproductive potential is shown to inevitably determine the resilience of the population over time (Kanarek [2006]). Further experiments are required for detailed results and analysis of specific circumstances that provoke the adaptation of certain behaviors.

The movement of the individuals is solely based on nearest-neighbour attraction/repulsion and reproduction is asexual. In this simple model emergent spatial organization of the individuals into clusters or groups is present even though all the individuals (predators and prey) are intra-specifically repelled by each other. The model ecosystem was used to determine whether an intra-specific attraction among the prey could increase their individual fitness. The attraction mechanism considered is such that when a prey is not affected by a predator or a plant then this prey is attracted to its nearest-neighbour prey. Under the assumptions of the parameterized model ecosystem, this mechanism seems highly selective on the individual level and it is evident that a population-based model could not assess this attraction mechanism. The main objective of this paper is to formalize mathematically an individual-based model and provide an example of a model tritrophic ecosystem that has the capabilities to assess evolutionary aspects of social behaviour in a prey species.

The aim of this paper is to estimate spatio-temporal parameters of an individual based model of Trichogramma female foraging behaviour in a mass rearing system. The system consists of Trichogramma brassicae (Bezdenko (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) and the host Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). This paper deals with the analysis of the foraging behaviour of single females.
2. We used direct visual observation for building an ethogram with the following behavioural states: searching, drumming, drilling, oviposition and host-feeding. We estimated the distribution of the time spent in the behavioural states using the gamma distribution and built a transition probability matrix between the behavioural states.
3. The mean time duration for searching, drumming, drilling and oviposition was similar for all behavioural states in our experiments and amounted to half of a minute. Host feeding, however, lasted more than 2 min.
4. An image analysis system was used to record the paths of single Trichogramma females foraging on a spatial lattice arrangement of host eggs. Paths were analysed using a vector autocorrelation function. The velocity vector was analysed separately for the speed and directional components, The analysis showed a short time memory for the directional process and a negligible memory for the speed component. We used a stochastic differential equation, an Ornstein Uhlenbeck-process, for modelling the directional changes. We then combined it with the information about the speed changes and obtained simulated paths. Visual assessment with recorded paths showed good agreement; the characteristic loops and circlings, as well as the longer meanders were faithfully represented. The theoretical and simulated processes overestimated the mean squared displacement in the first few hundred seconds but provided a good fit thereafter.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUN,1996,1023072404974,"SWISS FED RES STN AGRON, CH-8046 ZURICH RECKENHOL, SWITZERLAND./ETH ZURICH, INST PLANT SCI, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",NA,NA

Many scyphomedusae are cruising predators, and feeding rates depend, in part, on swimming behavior. Yet, no model of medusa swimming exists. An individual-based correlated random walk (CRW) model of medusa swimming behavior in three dimensions was developed. The model was validated using a previously published dataset of the swimming of 19 Chrysaora quinquecirrha (Desor, 1848) medusae that were observed in the presence or absence of zooplankton prey in laboratory mesocosms in August-October 1998 (Matanoski et al. in Mar Biol 139:191-200, 2001). In the presence of prey, medusae swam at a constant moderate rate in looping trajectories. In the absence of prey, medusae alternated periods of slow and fast swimming in more linear trajectories. In the model, looping trajectories were reproduced only when changes in movement by a medusa were oriented to its current position and orientation; more linear trajectories were reproduced by movement oriented to a fixed framework. This suggests that medusae change from swimming behavior oriented to local stimuli (e.g., contact with prey) to long-range stimuli (e.g., gravity) depending on the availability of prey. The model reproduced cyclical changes in swimming speeds by medusae in the absence of prey by simulating switching in the behavior controlling the strength of swimming bell pulsations using a probabilistic function. Model results also demonstrated that medusae tend to swim toward the surface, avoid contact with the bottom, increase time spent in prey patches if they alter swimming patterns in the presence of prey, and exhibit significant periodicities in swimming patterns that are the result of deterministic behavior. The model will permit the simulation of the complex behavior of medusae.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,JUN,2006,101007s0022700602441,"Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.","Matanoski, JC (reprint author), New Mexico State Univ, 2400 N Scen Dr, Alamogordo, NM 88310 USA.",10_1007_s00227_006_0244_1

Dennis, Todd E.",NA,NA,NA,"Context. Knowledge of the movements and space-use patterns of wildlife is crucial for implementation of effective conservation and management actions. Such information can be difficult to obtain, especially from hard-to-capture or far-ranging taxa. Global-positioning-system (GPS) receivers that have remote data-acquisition capability via satellite-communication networks offer an effective means of tracking highly mobile animals; however, often the equipment and operational costs of these devices are prohibitive.
Aim. To evaluate the operational performance and potential of an inexpensive, commercially available satellite-download GPS receiver that can be easily modified for use on wildlife, and to demonstrate its utility for revealing novel information on individual animal movements in an important wildlife management context. Methods. We added external batteries and supplementary waterproofing to 'off-the-shelf' SPOT Trace (R) GPS receivers (similar to$120 USD; Spot LLC, Covington, LA) that transmit recorded location data to users through the Globalstar satellite network. We then deployed these devices on eight wild black swans (Cygnus atratus) inhabiting a large inland marine harbor adjacent to Auckland International Airport and assessed the GPS units' operational performance and overall cost effectiveness.
Key results. During field trials with the tracking devices lasting up to 25 days we were able to collect thousands of precision location observations from the swans without the need for recapture. Cost-per-fix was only similar to$0.04 USD - up to an order of magnitude lower than some satellite-download GPS receivers manufactured specifically for wildlife. We provide novel information about the swans' patterns of activity, movement, space-use, habitat preferences and responses to actions taken by airport staff to scare problem individuals from threat zones.
Conclusions. User-modified satellite-download GPS devices can be a highly cost-effective means of tracking the movements of animals.
Implications. Knowledge of where and when swans present the greatest likely threat to air traffic and how they respond to displacement from restricted areas near the airport will be useful in devising threat-management plans. The ready availability of affordable remote-download GPS receivers will provide many new opportunities to study the movement and/or space-use patterns of wildlife and incorporate such information into a broad range of research and management programs.",NA,NA,2017,101071WR17064,NA,NA,NA

We outline an integrated approach to studying host-parasitoid interactions in heterogeneous natural landscapes. This approach involves conducting experiments to obtain critically important information on dispersal and boundary behavior of the host and parasitoid, large-scale manipulations of landscape structure to reveal the impacts of landscape change on host parasitoid interactions and temporal population dynamics, and the developtnent of spatially realistic, behavior-based landscape models. The dividends from such an integrative approach are far reaching, as is illustrated in our research on the prairie planthopper Prokelisia crocea and its egg parasitoid Anagrus columbi that occurs in the tall-grass prairies of North America. Here, we describe the population structure of this system which is based on a long-term survey of planthoppers and parasitoids among host plant patches. We also outline novel approaches to experimentally quantify and model the movement and boundary behavior of animals in general. The value of this information is revealed in a landscape-level field experiment that was designed to test predictions about how landscape change affects the spatial and temporal population dynamics of the host and parasitoid. Finally, with these empirical data as the foundation, we describe novel sitnulation models that are spatially realistic and behavior based, Drawing from this integrated approach and case study, we identify key research questions for the future.","ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG",MAR,2014,101016jbaae201401007,"[Cronin, James T.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA./[Reeve, John D.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.","Cronin, JT (reprint author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",NA

Most neuroimaging studies of human social cognition have focused on brain activity of single subjects. More recently, ""two-person neuroimaging"" has been introduced, with simultaneous recordings of brain signals from two subjects involved in social interaction. These simultaneous ""hyperscanning"" recordings have already been carried out with a spectrum of neuroimaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
Dual MEG Setup
We have recently developed a setup for simultaneous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of two subjects that communicate in real time over an audio link between two geographically separated MEG laboratories. Here we present an extended version of the setup, where we have added a video connection and replaced the telephone-landline-based link with an Internet connection. Our setup enabled transmission of video and audio streams between the sites with a one-way communication latency of about 130 ms. Our software that allows reproducing the setup is publicly available.
Validation
We demonstrate that the audiovisual Internet-based link can mediate real-time interaction between two subjects who try to mirror each others' hand movements that they can see via the video link. All the nine pairs were able to synchronize their behavior. In addition to the video, we captured the subjects' movements with accelerometers attached to their index fingers; we determined from these signals that the average synchronization accuracy was 215 ms. In one subject pair we demonstrate inter-subject coherence patterns of the MEG signals that peak over the sensorimotor areas contralateral to the hand used in the task.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 22,2015,101371journalpone0128485,"[Zhdanov, Andrey; Nurminen, Jussi; Baess, Pamela; Hirvenkari, Lotta; Jousmaki, Veikko; Mandel, Anne; Meronen, Lassi; Hari, Riitta; Parkkonen, Lauri] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Espoo, Finland./[Zhdanov, Andrey] Aalto Univ, Aalto Neuroimaging, MEG Core, Espoo, Finland./[Zhdanov, Andrey; Makela, Jyrki P.] Univ Helsinki, HUS Med Imaging Ctr, BioMag Lab, Helsinki, Finland./[Zhdanov, Andrey; Makela, Jyrki P.] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Helsinki, Finland.","Zhdanov, A (reprint author), Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Espoo, Finland.",10_1371_journal_pone_0128485

We use analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the effect of these nonlocal interactions on the long-time behavior of the patterns exhibited by the model. We establish the local existence and uniqueness and show that the nonlinear hyperbolic system does not develop shock solutions (gradient blow-up). Depending on the relative magnitudes of attraction and repulsion, we show that the solutions of the model either exist globally in time or may exhibit finite-lime amplitude blow-up. We illustrate numerically the various patterns displayed by the model dispersive aggregations, finite-size groups and blow-up patterns, the latter corresponding to aggregations which may collapse to a point. The transition from finite-size to blow-up patterns is governed by the magnitude of the social interactions and the random turning rates The presence of these types of patterns and the absence of shocks are consequences of the biologically relevant assumptions regarding the form of the speed and the turning rate functions, as well as of the kernels describing the social interactions.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,OCT,2010,101007s0028500903116,"[Fetecau, Razvan C.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Math, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada./[Eftimie, Raluca] McMaster Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.","Fetecau, RC (reprint author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Math, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",10_1007_s00285_009_0311_6

Acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the behaviour of spawning squid in relation to environmental variability.

In all, 45 squid were tagged (V9P-6L-S256 transmitters) and released within these arrays. Three presence-absence behaviours were identified: (i) arrival on the spawning site at dawn and departure after dusk, (ii) continuous presence for a number of days, and (iii) presence interrupted by frequent but short periods of absence. Movement between spawning sites was both diurnal and nocturnal. Squid presence at the monitored sites increased after dawn and decreased towards and after dusk. Occasionally, a core aggregation of squid remained on the spawning sites at night. Temperature data at the sites indicated occasional upwelling, and although the role of temperature in the spawning process is not well understood, data suggest that it is linked to the continuation and or interruption of spawning after an aggregation has formed.

The object-oriented approach is also linked to analytical theory through the development of matrix-based equations. An implementation of the model demonstrates how changes to basic population parameters affect spatial and temporal genetic structure. Scalar changes to the system affect the duration over which processes occur as well as the degree of variance, but appear to leave overall structural patterns unchanged.

The bilateral AFD neurons have been implicated as thermosensory neurons, but additional thermosensory neurons are also predicted to play a role in regulating thermotactic behaviors. Here, we show that the AWC olfactory neurons respond to temperature. Unlike AFD neurons, which respond to thermal stimuli with continuous, graded calcium signals, AWC neurons exhibit stochastic calcium events whose frequency is stimulus-correlated in a T-c-dependent manner. Animals lacking the AWC neurons or with hyperactive AWC neurons exhibit defects in the regulation of reorientation rate in thermotactic behavior.

Evaluation was made on animals that were introduced in the ordinary slaughterhouse planning, presumably with no signs of impaired locomotion or severe lameness. A total of 4292 hind feet (right and left) belonging to 153 batches were collected (average feet/batch 28.1 +/- 5.62 (SD)) in 3 abattoirs in Northern Italy at 3 time points (April-June and September-October 2016; February March 2017). One veterinarian performed the claw trimming first and then scored the presence of specific claw disorders and their position on the sole considering 7 zones (in the digital and interdigital areas). All claw disorders in a specific zone were recorded as binary (presence/absence). Infectious (ILS), non-infectious (NILS), and global (GLS) scores were calculated considering both the type of claw disorder detected and the number of zones affected. Non-infectious disorders were the most common diagnoses among batches, mainly on the lateral claws and in the heel-sole junction area. In particular, white line abscesses and ulcers (sole and toe ulcers) were also found as two of the most debilitating and painful lesions with a non-negligible frequency. Infectious diseases, when occurring in a batch, spread to almost all feet. As expected, GLS distribution on the total feet inspected showed a non-harmful condition, given that the worst scores from 3 to 13 were assigned to a restricted sample of feet (15%) and were far from the maximum potential value of 50. However, the GLS of all batches monitored revealed 10 critical batches having no healthy feet or more than 50% of feet graded with the worst scores.
Since right and left feet of the same animal showed similar clinical diagnoses, a more efficient claw health evaluation system should consider only one foot.
Although all cattle inspected were supposed to have no evident locomotory problems before slaughter, the detection of several foot disorders and the considerable distribution in some batches might suggest poor conditions on farms affecting finishing beef cattle health, behaviour, and welfare. It is therefore advisable that possible predisposing factors of specific claw disorders on the farms of origin be investigated more deeply.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,DEC 1,2018,101016jprevetmed201810018,"[Magrin, Luisa; Brscic, Marta; Armato, Leonardo; Contiero, Barbara; Cozzi, Giulio; Gottardo, Flaviana] Univ Padua, Dept Anim Med Prod & Hlth, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.","Magrin, L (reprint author), Univ Padua, Dept Anim Med Prod & Hlth, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",NA

We developed an annotation protocol and tools to accumulate large datasets of music therapy, for analysis of interaction dynamics. Analysis of video recordings of improvisational music therapy sessions focused on simple, unambiguous individual and shared behaviours: movement and facing behaviours, rhythmic activity and musical structures and the relationships between them. To test the feasibility of the protocol, early and late sessions of five client therapist pairs were annotated and analysed to track changes in behaviours. To assess the reliability and validity of the protocol, inter-rater reliability of the annotation tiers was calculated, and the therapists provided feedback about the relevance of the analyses and results. This small-scale study suggests that there are both similarities and differences in the profiles of client therapist sessions. For example, all therapists faced the clients most of the time, while the clients did not face back so often. Conversely, only two pairs had an increase in regular pulse from early to late sessions. More broadly, similarity across pairs at a general level is complemented by variation in the details. This perhaps goes some way to reconciling client- and context-specificity on one hand and generalizability on the other. Behavioural characteristics seem to influence each other. For instance, shared rhythmic pulse alternated with mutual facing and the occurrence of shared pulse was found to relate to the musical structure. These observations point towards a framework for looking at change in music therapy that focuses on networks of variables or broader categories. The results suggest that even when starting with simple behaviours, we can trace aspects of interaction and change in music therapy, which are seen as relevant by therapists.",ROYAL SOC,MAY 5,2016,101098rstb20150374,"[Spiro, Neta] Nordoff Robbins, Res Dept, 2 Lissenden Gardens, London NW5 1PQ, England./[Himberg, Tommi] Aalto Univ, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Rakentajanaukio 2C, Espoo 02150, Finland.","Spiro, N (reprint author), Nordoff Robbins, Res Dept, 2 Lissenden Gardens, London NW5 1PQ, England.",4843612

multi-event model","1. The environment of most species is heterogeneous at different spatial and temporal scales; this heterogeneity can have a direct effect on various components of fitness. As a consequence, individual space-use and movement strategies are central issues in ecology and conservation and receive considerable attention from researchers.
2. In the last 30 years, this issue has led to the development of capture-recapture models that allow movement between sites to be quantified, while handling imperfect detection. For studies involving numerous recapture sites in which the emphasis is on dispersal or migration rather than movement between particular sites, Lagrange et al. recently proposed a parsimonious CR multi-event model that contrasts individuals that move and individuals that stay in place, irrespective of the sites involved.
3. In this study, we developed a generalized version of this model to allow survival probability and movement probability to differ for different types of habitat to which the individual sites may be assigned. We investigated the potential of this new parameterization by studying the movements of an amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata), in a set of breeding and resting/foraging ponds.
4. Our capture-recapture multi-event model provides a highly flexible tool allowing users to model movements within and between several habitats. This approach can be potentially used to study movement behaviour and space-use strategies of a wide range of taxa.",WILEY,SEP,2017,1011112041210X12717,"[Cayuela, Hugo; Joly, Pierre] Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Nat & Anthropises, UMR LEHNA 5023, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France./[Cayuela, Hugo; Pradel, Roger; Besnard, Aurelien] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, PSL Res Univ,Lab Biogeog & Ecol Vertebres, CNRS,CEFE UMR 5175,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.","Cayuela, H (reprint author), Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Nat & Anthropises, UMR LEHNA 5023, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France.; Cayuela, H (reprint author), Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, PSL Res Univ,Lab Biogeog & Ecol Vertebres, CNRS,CEFE UMR 5175,EPHE, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",10_1111_2041_210X_12717

spatiotemporal point pattern analysis","Movement behaviour plays an important role in many ecological interactions. As animals move through the environment, they generate movement patterns, which are a combined result of landscape characteristics and species-specific behaviour. Measuring these ranging patterns is being facilitated by technological advances in collection methods, such as GPS collars, that are capturing movement on finer spatial and temporal scales. We propose the use of a novel spatiotemporal analytical framework (ST-BBD), based on the beta-binomial distribution (BBD) model, to measure small-scale aggregation in animal movement data sets, including two simulated and three collected primate data sets. We use this approach to distinguish different habitat uses of three primate species (red colobus, Procolobus rufomitratus, black howler, Alouatta pigra, and spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi) and quantify their specific use of the landscape in space and in time, using a parameter of the BBD that measures the variation in sites visited on a landscape. We found that estimates of aggregation in habitat use were higher in the frugivorous spider monkey, compared to the more folivorous howler monkey, and that in the red colobus, aggregation in site visits was dependent on group size and food availability. Applications of this framework to animal movement data could be useful in understanding ecological systems where habitat use is an important factor, such as the relationships between hosts and parasites, or parent plants and seed dispersers.

As it is impossible to separate the individual semimonostatic parameters from the bistatic raw data, the searched parameters are derived from the tracks of the moving platforms. For this reason, global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS) position and velocity data of transmitter and receiver are combined in an optimal way by a Kalman filter approach. As a consequence of model-based interpolation, we can easily determine varying parameters like Doppler centroid frequency, azimuth velocity, and the bistatic parameters alpha(2) and alpha(0) referring to the illuminated scene at each time instant. Accurately determined position and velocity of the transmitter and receiver enable a first-order bistatic motion compensation (MC), which is also described in this paper. In verifying our approach, GPS/INS tracks and raw data of a bistatic airborne SAR experiment flown in 2003 were used, where the data were provided by Forschungsgesellschaft fur Angewandte Naturwissenschaften e.V., Wachtberg, Germany. The focusing was done by a scaled inverse Fourier transformation processor for nearly parallel trajectories for transmitter and receiver.

Here we analyze the movement patterns of a tagged female Blainville's beaked whale in reaction to playback of killer whale predation calls. During a deep foraging dive, the whale was exposed to a playback of killer whale vocalizations with the source level slowly increased until the whale prematurely ceased foraging. The heading data from the tag were analyzed using a rotation test with a likelihood ratio calculated for a nonparametric kernel density estimate. We found a significant difference (P<0.005) in the distribution of heading (the change in heading averaged over 200 s) after the cessation of the killer whale playback. A test of the angular standard deviation (SD) of the heading showed that after the playback, the SD was significantly reduced (P=0.0064), which indicates that the animal maintained a straighter than normal course for an extended period of time.

In particular, we want to see the behavior of the system in the presence of non-local interaction. Introduction of non-local intraspecific competition in prey population leads to some new characteristics in comparison with the local model. Comparisons have been made between the local and non-local interactions of the system. The range of non-local interaction enlarges the parametric domain on which stationary patterns exist. The periodic oscillation for the local model in the Hopf domain can be stabilized by suitable limit of strong non-local interaction. An increase in the range of non-local interaction increases the Turing domain up to a certain level, and then, it decreases. Also, increasing the range of non-local interaction results in the overlap of nearby foraging areas and hence alters the size of the localized patches and formation of multiple stationary patches. Numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the analytical findings and to establish the existence of multiple stationary patterns, oscillatory solution, two-periodic solution and other spatiotemporal dynamics.",SPRINGER,APR,2018,101007s115380180410x,"[Pal, S.; Ghorai, S.; Banerjee, M.] IIT Kanpur, Dept Math & Stat, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.","Banerjee, M (reprint author), IIT Kanpur, Dept Math & Stat, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",10_1007_s11538_018_0410_x

Papastamatiou, Yannis P.",NA,NA,NA,"1. Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses.
Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Depending on the aim of an analysis, an HMM can be used for state prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an HMM is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states may not map to specific behaviours.
We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an HMM in both the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. HMMs were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour.
Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The HMM framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.",NA,FEB,2017,1011112041210X12657,NA,NA,NA

However, specific habitats essential to survival can be difficult to determine for highly mobile marine animals, especially when these species are rare or endangered.
2. Active acoustic tracking telemetry was used to determine daily activity spaces and rates of movement of juvenile smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) in critical habitat areas of south-west Florida, USA.
3. Activity space size and rates of movement were positively related with the size of the area where the animal was tracked. Overall, activity spaces were small and ranged from 0.07-0.17 km(2) using 95% minimum convex polygons, 0.01-0.16 km(2) based on 50% kernel density estimates (KDE), and 0.08-0.68 km(2) based on 95% KDE. Rates of movement ranged from 2.4 to 6.1 m min(-1).
4. There were no detectable differences in activity space or rates of movement between ebb and flood tide or high or low tide. Activity space decreased and rates of movement increased at night, possibly related to nocturnal foraging behaviour or predator avoidance. Comparisons of tracked animal locations and random locations suggested there was selection for those habitats in close proximity to mangrove shoreline.

Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, Current probability, or ""expected maturity"" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed.
Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with Changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were hi-hest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-model in g approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,JUL,2002,1018900012965820020831817AOHSRU20CO2,"Lang Railsback & Associates, Arcata, CA 95521 USA./US Forest Serv, Redwood Sci Lab, Pacific SW Res Stn, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.","Railsback, SF (reprint author), Lang Railsback & Associates, 250 Calif Ave, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",NA

Until recently, exploring human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places) behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205 volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.",TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,MAY 3,2016,1.01080136588162E+024,"[Sila-Nowicka, Katarzyna; Long, Jed A.; Demsar, Urska] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland./[Sila-Nowicka, Katarzyna] Univ Glasgow, Urban Big Data Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland./[Vandrol, Jan] Cranfield Univ, Sch Energy Environm Technol & Agrifood, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England./[Oshan, Taylor; Fotheringham, A.

The fundamental diagrams were obtained from the numerical simulation results. The varying sensitivity and smooth factor of autonomous cars affect traffic flux, which exhibits opposite varying tendency with increasing parameters before and after the critical density.

Extracting information from the integrated smart phone sensors, such as motion, light and proximity, is a common technique for phone placement detection. In this paper, the efficiency of an accelerometer-only solution is explored, and it is investigated whether the phone position can be detected with high accuracy by analyzing the movement, orientation and rotation changes. The impact of these changes on the performance is analyzed individually and both in combination to explore which features are more efficient, whether they should be fused and, if yes, how they should be fused. Using three different datasets, collected from 35 people from eight different positions, the performance of different classification algorithms is explored. It is shown that while utilizing only motion information can achieve accuracies around 70%, this ratio increases up to 85% by utilizing information also from orientation and rotation changes. The performance of an accelerometer-only solution is compared to solutions where linear acceleration, gyroscope and magnetic field sensors are used, and it is shown that the accelerometer-only solution performs as well as utilizing other sensing information. Hence, it is not necessary to use extra sensing information where battery power consumption may increase. Additionally, I explore the impact of the performed activities on position recognition and show that the accelerometer-only solution can achieve 80% recognition accuracy with stationary activities where movement data are very limited. Finally, other phone placement problems, such as in-pocket and on-body detections, are also investigated, and higher accuracies, ranging from 88% to 93%, are reported, with an accelerometer-only solution.",NA,OCT,2015,103390s151025474,NA,NA,4634510

Encouraging active travel solutions is seen as a means of improving the sustainability, health, and cohesiveness of a community. Unfortunately, information about volume, trip origin and destination, travel time, and personal interactions is difficult to obtain because of a lack of sensor infrastructure and unrestricted movement of these modes. Therefore, information is often limited to annual surveys and model estimates that are insufficient to address the increasing needs of sustainable planning and large-scale behavior studies. An automated, cost-effective approach to acquiring pedestrian data is desirable. The emergence of Bluetooth sensors as a means of gathering travel time data for traffic analysis presents an opportunity to use the same technology for pedestrian travel analysis. However, because people generally carry more Bluetooth devices in their vehicles than they do on their person, making representative sample sizes is a challenge. A study of pedestrian detection with Bluetooth technology is presented at two sites (Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Seattle, Washington) to investigate the feasibility of Bluetooth technology for pedestrian studies.

We used radiotelemetry to record nightly movements of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in two 41.4-km(2) study areas in North Dakota. Study areas contained either 15-20% grassland (low grassland composition) or 45-55% grassland (high grassland composition). Grasslands included planted cover, pastureland, and hayland. We predicted that the type and composition of cover types in the landscape would influence both predator movement across the landscape (as measured by the fractal dimension and displacement ratio) as well as localized movement (as measured by the rate of movement and turning angle between locations) within patches of different cover types. Red fox movements were straighter (lower fractal dimensions and higher displacements) across landscapes with a low grassland composition, indicating directed movement between the more isolated patches of planted cover. Striped skunk movements did not differ between landscape types, illustrating their movement along wetland edges, which had similar compositions in both landscape types. The high variability in turning angles by red fox in planted cover and pastureland in both landscape types is consistent with restricted-area foraging. The high rate of movement by red foxes in planted cover and by striped skunks in wetland edges suggests that spatial memory may influence movement patterns.

The background is reasonably well modeled by tilt-modulated Bragg scattering, whereas the spikes may be associated with the scattering on steepened and/or breaking waves. Moreover, it is shown that the influence of microbreakers has to be taken into account to explain the relatively high polarization ratio.

These data, together with laboratory measurements of metabolism. allowed us to estimate the proportion of the total daily energy expended by animals in three types of behavior: resting in their burrows, sitting out of their burrows, and in activity. Although there was a seasonal variation in the total energy expended per day, the proportions spent in the three types of behavior were similar during summer and spring, but a smaller proportion was expended for activity during winter. Nevertheless, the lizards were not completely inactive during winter; they emerged from their burrows and spent several hours above ground, although the mean time spent in activity during this season was only 10.5 min/day compared to 47.6 and 22.2 min/day during summer and spring. We estimate the energy expenditure for the entire population to range from 23.6 kJ ha-1 day-1 during winter to 117.3 kj ha-1 day-1 during summer. The time spent in activity by this species is strongly seasonal and is positively correlated to the daily solar radiation. However, even during summer, the season of greatest activity, the time spent in activity is not great (mean = 47.6 min/day; range = 12.3-141.3 min/day) compared to the tropical iguanas Conolophus pallidus(mean 100 min/day) and Cyclura nubila (mean = 92 min/day) and the tropical varanid V. panoptes (mean = 228 min/day during the dry season, its season of greatest activity).

Group size variations, high animal densities and social factors may exacerbate these effects. A better understanding of space use by captive animals will permit us to design facilities that best adjust to their biological requirements and hence, maximize their welfare. Some of the most interesting parameters generated in the wildlife literature to describe space use include calculations of distance traveled, tortuosity of movement and core areas based on Kernel estimators. However, it is unknown how these parameters, and core areas particularly, will behave when the range of an animal's movement is limited, animal locations are more abundant in the periphery of the enclosure, and data autocorrelation may be higher than for animals in the wild. In this methodological study using domestic fowl as our captive animal model we calculated distance traveled, angular dispersion (to measure tortuosity), and core areas. Using simulation techniques we determined the response of these parameters to different sampling efforts and sample size. Our results indicated that long sampling intervals resulted in significantly shorter estimates of distance traveled, path of movement was significantly more linear (less tortuous), the core areas that were significantly larger than the observed estimates from ad libitum sampling. However, longer sampling duration had a positive effect on angular dispersion and core area estimates. Reduction in sample size did not change our results regarding effects of sampling intensity and duration but affected the conclusions for group size effects. We conclude that priority should be given to increase sampling effort versus concerns arising for potential data autocorrelation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Obtaining a complete phenotypic characterization of a freely moving organism is a difficult task, yet such a description is desired in many neuroethological studies. Many metrics currently used in the literature to describe locomotor and exploratory behavior are typically based on average quantities or subjectively chosen spatial and temporal thresholds. All of these measures are relatively coarse-grained in the time domain. It is advantageous, however, to employ metrics based on the entire trajectory that an organism takes while exploring its environment. Methodology/Principal Findings. To characterize the locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, we used a video tracking system to record the trajectory of a single fly walking in a circular open field arena. The fly was tracked for two hours. Here, we present techniques with which to analyze the motion of the fly in this paradigm, and we discuss the methods of calculation. The measures we introduce are based on spatial and temporal probability distributions and utilize the entire time-series trajectory of the fly, thus emphasizing the dynamic nature of locomotor behavior. Marginal and joint probability distributions of speed, position, segment duration, path curvature, and reorientation angle are examined and related to the observed behavior. Conclusions/Significance. The measures discussed in this paper provide a detailed profile of the behavior of a single fly and highlight the interaction of the fly with the environment. Such measures may serve as useful tools in any behavioral study in which the movement of a fly is an important variable and can be incorporated easily into many setups, facilitating high-throughput phenotypic characterization.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,OCT 24,2007,101371journalpone0001083,"[Valente, Dan; Mitra, Partha P.] Cold Spring Harbor Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA./[Golani, Ilan] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","Valente, D (reprint author), Cold Spring Harbor Lab, POB 100, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0001083

Using Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus), nocturnal cavity-roosting woodpeckers, as a model, I describe a method for analyzing geolocator data that initially adjusts light transitions to account for differences between the time of minimum light threshold and when a bird enters or exits a cavity. Using known locations from the breeding grounds, I assessed the precision of this adjustment method for estimating location by examining the associated error, the repeatability of the length of time individuals roosted in cavities, and by conducting a sensitivity analysis to assess uncertainty. Mean location error decreased from 1417 277 km (SD) to 129 194 km when sunrise and sunset times were adjusted and locations from >25 d were averaged. Sensitivity analysis showed that if an adjusted sunrise or sunset time was incorrect by 10 min, the error was 121-137 km from the actual location. This adjustment method significantly improved location estimates at known sites, suggesting that adjusting light transitions based off a calibration is a good initial step for determining location. However, to account for behavioral changes in entrance and emergence times, applying state-space Kalman filter models can further improve the accuracy of location estimates. The combination of adjusting transitions and applying a state-space Kalman filter thus allows location estimates to be obtained from cavity-roosting species using geolocator data.
RESUMEN Un analisis de datos de geolocalizadores por aves que usan cavidades como dormideros todo el ano El uso de geolocalizadores sensibles a la luz para el monitoreo de la migracion se ha limitado a las especies que no usan cavidades como dormideros porque las transiciones de luz son oscurecidos en cavidades. Los pajaros carpinteros nocturnos, Colaptes auratus, usan cavidades como dormideros y fueron usados como modelo para describir un metodo para el analisis de datos de geolocalizadores que inicialmente se ajusta las transiciones de luz para dar cuenta de las diferencias entre el momento del umbral minimo de luz y cuando un pajaro entra o sale de una cavidad.

These echoes were caused by high-flying insects, migrating birds, and large colonies of bats emerging from roosts to feed. Modern weather-surveillance radar stations in the United States (NEXt-generation RADar or NEXRAD) provide detailed images that clearly show evening bat emergences from large colonies. These images can be used to investigate the flight behavior of groups of bats and population trends in large colonies of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in south-central Texas which are clearly imaged by local NEXRAD radar stations. In this study, we used radar reflectivity data from the New Braunfels, Texas NEXRAD station to examine relative colony size, direction of movement, speed of dispersion, and altitude gradients of bats from these colonies following evening emergence. Base reflectivity clear-air-mode Level-II images were geo-referenced and compiled in a GIS along with locations of colonies and features on the landscape. Temporal sequences of images were filtered for the activity of bats, and from this, the relative size of bat colonies, and the speed and heading of bat emergences were calculated. Our results indicate cyclical changes in colony size from year to year and that initial headings taken by bats during emergence flights are highly directional. We found that NEXRAD data can be an effective tool for monitoring the nightly behavior and seasonal changes in these large colonies. Understanding the distribution of a large regional bat population on a landscape scale has important implications for agricultural pest management and conservation efforts.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JUL,2008,101093icbicn051,"[Horn, Jason W.; Kunz, Thomas H.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","Horn, JW (reprint author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, 5 Cummington St, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",NA

Basile, George",ECOL SOC,PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; MODEL,"framework for strategic sustainable development; planetary boundaries;
planning; strategy; sustainability; tipping points","Recently, an approach for global sustainability, the planetary-boundary approach (PBA), has been proposed, which combines the concept of tipping points with global-scale sustainability indicators. The PBA could represent a significant step forward in monitoring and managing known and suspected global sustainability criteria. However, as the authors of the PBA describe, the approach faces numerous and fundamental challenges that must be addressed, including successful identification of key global sustainability metrics and their tipping points, as well as the coordination of systemic individual and institutional actions that are required to address the sustainability challenges highlighted. We apply a previously published framework for systematic and strategic development toward a robust basic definition of sustainability, i.e., the framework for strategic sustainable development (FSSD), to improve and inform the PBA. The FSSD includes basic principles for sustainability, and logical guidelines for how to approach their fulfillment. It is aimed at preventing unsustainable behavior at both the micro, e. g., individual firm, and macro, i.e., global, levels, even when specific global sustainability symptoms and metrics are not yet well understood or even known. Whereas the PBA seeks to estimate how far the biosphere can be driven away from a ""normal"" or ""natural"" state before tipping points are reached, because of ongoing violations of basic sustainability principles, the FSSD allows for individual planners to move systematically toward sustainability before all impacts from not doing so, or their respective tipping points, are known. Critical weaknesses in the PBA can, thus, be overcome by a combined approach, significantly increasing both the applicability and efficacy of the PBA, as well as informing strategies developed in line with the FSSD, e. g., by providing a ""global warning system"" to help prioritize strategic actions highlighted by the FSSD. Thus, although ongoing monitoring of known and suspected global sustainability metrics and their possible tipping points is a critical part of the evolving sustainability landscape, effective and timely utilization of planetary-boundary information on multiple scales requires coupling to a strategic approach that makes the underlying sustainability principles explicit and includes strategic guidelines to approach them. Outside of such a rigorous and systems-based context, the PBA, even given its global scale, risks leading individual organizations or planners to (i) focus on ""shares"" of, e.g., pollution within the PBs and negotiations to get as high proportion of such as possible, and/or (ii) awaiting data on PBs when such do not yet exist before they act, and/or (iii) find it difficult to manage uncertainties of the data once such have arrived. If global sustainability problems are to be solved, it is important that each actor recognizes the benefits, not the least self-benefits, of designing and executing strategies toward a principled and scientifically robust definition of sustainability. This claim is not only based on theoretical reasoning. A growing number of sectors, businesses, and municipalities/cities around the world are already doing it, i.e., not estimating ""allowed"" shares of, say fossil CO2 emissions, but gradually moving away from unsustainable use of fossil fuels and other unsustainable practices altogether.",RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,NA,2013,105751ES05336180205,"[Robert, Karl-Henrik; Broman, Goeran I.] Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden./[Basile, George] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.","Robert, KH (reprint author), Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden.",NA

This study developed an adaptive data analysis method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to reveal the biological cues behind intricate motion. The method was used to classify the strains of worms according to their gaitprints (i.e., phenotypic traits of locomotion). First, a norm of the locomotory pattern was created from the worm of interest. The body curvature of the worm was decomposed into four intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A radar chart showing correlations between the predefined database and measured worm was then obtained by dividing each IMF into three parts, namely, head, mid-body, and tail. A comprehensive resemblance score was estimated after k-means clustering. Simulated data that use sinusoidal waves were generated to assess the feasibility of the algorithm. Results suggested that temporal frequency is the major factor in the process. In practice, five worm strains, including wildtype N2, TJ356 (zIs356), CL2070 (dvIs70), CB0061 (dpy-5), and CL2120 (dvIs14), were investigated. The overall classification accuracy of the gaitprint analyses of all the strains reached nearly 89%.

To identify the spatial similarity of trips at a finer scale, this paper investigates the distribution of trips through topic modeling techniques. Firstly, trip origins and trip destinations were identified from raw GPS data. Then, different trips were given semantic information, i.e., link identification numbers with a semantic enrichment process. Each taxi trajectory was composed of a series of trip destinations corresponding to the same taxi. Subsequently, each taxi trajectory was analogous to a document consisting of different words, and all taxi's trajectories could be regarded as document corpora, enabling a semantic analysis of massive trip destinations. Finally, we obtained different trip destination topics reflecting the spatial similarity and regional property of human mobility through LDA topic model training.

The top extant big cat in the Middle East and the Caucasus, the Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor, has disappeared from most of its historic range. Its spatial ecology in the areas where it remains is almost unknown. Between September 2014 and May 2017, we collared and monitored six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) using GPS-satellite Iridium transmitters in Tandoureh National Park (355 km(2)) along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderland. Using auto-correlated Kernel density estimation based on a continuous-time stochastic process for relocation data, we estimated a mean home range of 103.4 +/- SE 51.8 km(2) for resident males which is larger than has been observed in other studies of Asian leopards. Most predation events occurred in core areas, averaging 32.4 +/- SE 12.7 km(2). Although neighboring leopards showed high spatiotemporal overlap, their hunting areas were largely exclusive. Five out of six of leopards spent some time outside the national park, among human communities. Our study suggests that a national park can play an 'anchoring' role for individuals of an apex predator that spend some time in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, we envisage that instead of emphasizing either land sharing or land sparing, a combined approach can secure the viability of resilient large carnivores that are able to coexist with humans in the rugged montane landscapes of west and central Asia.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 2,2018,101371journalpone0196602,"[Farhadinia, Mohammad S.; Johnson, Paul J.; Macdonald, David W.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Oxford, Oxon, England./[Farhadinia, Mohammad S.] Future4Leopards Fdn, Tehran, Iran./[Hunter, Luke T.

Nonetheless, few studies show that mammals actually use corridors as predicted. Further, the assumptions underlying corridor models are rarely validated with field data. We categorized corridor use as a behavior, to identify animal-defined corridors, using movement data from fishers (Martes pennanti) tracked near Albany, New York, USA. We then used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to predict fisher corridors and validated the performance of all three corridor models with data from camera traps. Six of eight fishers tracked used corridors to connect the forest patches that constitute their home ranges, however the locations of these corridors were not well predicted by the two cost-based models, which together identified only 5 of the 23 used corridors. Further, camera trap data suggest the cost-based corridor models performed poorly, often detecting fewer fishers and mammals than nearby habitat cores, whereas camera traps within animal-defined corridors recorded more passes made by fishers, carnivores, and all other non-target mammal groups. Our results suggest that (1) fishers use corridors to connect disjunct habitat fragments, (2) animal movement data can be used to identify corridors at local scales, (3) camera traps are useful tools for testing corridor model predictions, and (4) that corridor models can be improved by incorporating animal behavior data.

Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR,2011,101371journalpcbi1002008,"[Giuggioli, Luca; Potts, Jonathan R.] Univ Bristol, Bristol Ctr Complex Sci, Bristol, Avon, England./[Giuggioli, Luca] Univ Bristol, Dept Engn Math, Bristol, Avon, England./[Giuggioli, Luca; Potts, Jonathan R.; Harris, Stephen] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.","Giuggioli, L (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Bristol Ctr Complex Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",10_1371_journal_pcbi_1002008

Problems arise because selection does not ordinarily act on populations and because organisms of many taxa (including birds) are clearly migrants, but fail to undertake movements of the kind described. There are also extensive return movements that are not migratory. I propose that it is more useful to think of migration as a syndrome of behavioral and other traits that function together within individuals, and that such a syndrome provides a common ground across taxa from aphids to albatrosses. Large-scale return movements of populations are one outcome of the syndrome. Similar behavioral and physiological traits serve both to define migration and to provide a test for it. I use two insect (Hemipteran) examples to illustrate migratory syndromes and to demonstrate that, in many migrants, behavior and physiology correlate with life history and morphological traits to form syndromes at two levels. I then compare the two Hemipterans with migration in birds, butterflies, and fish to assess the question of whether there are migratory syndromes in common between these diverse migrants. Syndromes are more similar at the level of behavior than when morphology and life history traits are included. Recognizing syndromes leads to important evolutionary questions concerning migration strategies, trade-offs, the maintenance of genetic variance and the responses of migratory syndromes to both similar and different selective regimes.",SPRINGER,APR,2006,101007s1033600500522,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA./Univ Queensland, Sch Integrat Biol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","Dingle, H (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",NA

We propose an approach for obtaining resource selection inference from animal location data that accounts for complicated error structures, movement constraints, and temporally autocorrelated observations. We specify a model for telemetry data observed with error conditional on unobserved true locations that reflects prior knowledge about constraints in the animal movement process. The observed telemetry data are modeled using a flexible distribution that accommodates extreme errors and complicated error structures. Although constraints to movement are often viewed as a nuisance, we use constraints to simultaneously estimate and account for telemetry error. We apply the model to simulated data, showing that it outperforms common ad hoc approaches used when confronted with measurement error and movement constraints.

We evaluated animal movement responses to variable resource distributions using the grey teal (Anas gracilis) in agricultural and desert landscapes in Australia as a model system. Birds in the two landscapes differed in the fractal dimension of their movement paths, with teal in the desert landscape moving less tortuously overall than their counterparts in the agricultural landscape. However, the most striking result was the high levels of individual variability in movement strategies, with different animals exhibiting different responses to the same resources. Teal in the agricultural basin moved with both high and low tortuosity, while teal in the desert basin primarily moved using low levels of tortuosity. These results call into question the idea that broad-scale movement patterns simply reflect underlying resource distributions, and suggest that movement responses in some animals may be behaviourally complex regardless of the spatial scale over which movement occurs.",SPRINGER,MAY,2008,101007s0044200809870,"[Roshier, David A.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia./[Doerr, Veronica A.

Animal movement strategies, in turn, interact with the characteristics of individuals and the local distribution of resources to determine local patterns of resource selection with complex and poorly understood implications for animal fitness. Here we present a multi-scale investigation of animal movement strategies and resource selection. We consider the degree to which spatial variation, seasonality, and inter-annual predictability in resources drive migration patterns among different taxa and how movement strategies in turn shape local resource selection patterns. We focus on adult Galapagos giant tortoises Chelonoidis spp. as a model system since they display many movement strategies and evolved in the absence of predators of adults. Specifically, our analysis is based on 63 individuals among four taxa tracked on three islands over six years and almost 106 tortoise re-locations. Tortoises displayed a continuum of movement strategies from migration to sedentarism that were linked to the spatio-temporal scale and predictability of resource distributions. Movement strategies shaped patterns of resource selection. Specifically, migratory individuals displayed stronger selection toward areas where resources were more predictable among years than did non-migratory individuals, which indicates a selective advantage for migrants in seasonally structured, more predictable environments. Our analytical framework combines large-scale predictions for movement strategies, based on environmental structuring, with finer-scale analysis of space-use. Integrating different organizational levels of analysis provides a deeper understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics at play in the emergence and maintenance of migration and the critical role of resource predictability.

Telemetry data provide a way to observe geographic position of animals over time, but not necessarily changes in the dynamics of the movement process. Continuous-time models allow for statistical predictions of the trajectory in the presence of measurement error and during periods when the telemetry device did not record the animal's position. However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking realistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging to fit to large datasets. Furthermore, basic continuous-time model specifications (e.g. Brownian motion) lack realism in their ability to capture nonstationary dynamics.
2. We present a unified class of animal movement models that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and interactions among individuals. Our approach uses process convolutions to allow for flexibility in the movement process while facilitating implementation and incorporating location uncertainty. We show how to nest convolution models to incorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for nonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks.
3. We demonstrate these approaches in two case studies involving migratory birds. Specifically, we used process convolution models with temporal deformation to account for heterogeneity in individual greater white-fronted goose migrations in Europe and Iceland, and we used nested process convolutions to model dynamic migratory networks in sandhill cranes in North America.

We describe several theoretical approaches for modeling the diffusion, foraging behavior, and population dynamics of animals in heterogeneous landscapes, including: (1) scaling relationships derived from percolation theory and fractal geometry, (2) extensions of traditional patch-based metapopulation models, and (3) individual-based, spatially explicit models governed by local rules.

Identifying these intensively used areas makes it possible, through subsequent analyses, to address both how they are distributed with respect to key habitat features, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms used to find these areas and capitalize on such habitats. We critically reviewed the few previously published methods to detect changes in movement behavior likely to occur when an animal enters a pro. table place.

For larger organisms, propulsion contributes significantly to progress but the flow usually still provides significant opposition or assistance, or produces lateral displacement ('drift'). Animals show a range of responses to flows, depending on the direction of the flow relative to their preferred direction, the speed of the flow relative to their own self-propelled speed, the incidence of flows in different directions and the proportion of the journey remaining. We here present a classification of responses based on the direction of the resulting movement relative to flow and preferred direction, which is applicable to a range of taxa and environments. The responses adopted in particular circumstances are related to the organisms' locomotory and sensory capacities and the environmental cues available. Advances in biologging technologies and particle tracking models are now providing a wealth of data, which often demonstrate a striking level of convergence in the strategies that very different animals living in very different environments employ when moving in a flow.",CELL PRESS,OCT 25,2011,101016jcub201108014,"[Chapman, Jason W.; Reynolds, Andrew M.] Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England./[Klaassen, Raymond H.

In these environments, all resources reside within the smallest patches, and resource density declines as a constant exponent of patch size. Accordingly, we use simple mathematical formulations to describe a self-similar environment and a null model of how animals should respond to this environment if they do not perceive resource distribution. We then argue that animals that can perceive resource distribution should partition space by reducing the relative time searching between patches as patch size increases. On an experimental landscape, we found that woolly bear caterpillars Grammia geneura could partition space in this manner, but the range of patch sizes over which they did so tended to increase with resource aggregation. Nevertheless, scaling efficiency (i.e. the scaling of search time versus the scaling or resource density) was similar in all distributions when averaged over all patch sizes. These disparate patterns with similar outcomes resulted from differences in caterpillars' abilities to discriminate spatially among patches of different sizes via their movement pathways, and differences in their use of speed to detect resource items. Our work is relevant to the characterization of resource availability from an animal's perspective, and to the linking of optimal foraging theory to the modeling of search behavior.","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MAY,2009,101111j16000706200817117x,"[McClure, Mark F.; Shipley, Lisa A.] Washington State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.","McClure, MF (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",NA

However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Levy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Levy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to, sustain Levy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Levy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Levy walks. This model shows that Levy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the. ability of performing Levy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.",WILEY,NOV,2005,101890041806,"CSIC, CEAB, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain./Univ Pompeu Fabra, ICREA, Complex Syst Res Lab, Barcelona 08003, Spain./Univ Fed Parana, Dept Fis, BR-81531990 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil./Univ Fed Alagoas, Dept Fis, BR-57072970 Maceio, AL, Brazil.","Bartumeus, F (reprint author), CSIC, CEAB, Acces Cala St Francesc, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain.",NA

LIKELIHOOD; EMERGENCE",NA,"How to differentiate between scale-free space use like Levy walk and a two-level scale-specific process like composite random walk (mixture of intra- and inter-patch habitat movement) is surrounded by controversy. Composite random walk may under some parameter conditions appear Levy walk-like from the perspective of the path's distribution of step lengths due to superabundance of very long steps relative to the expectation from a classic (single-level) random walk. However, a more explicit focus on the qualitative differences between studying movement at a high resolution mechanistic (behavioral) level and the more coarse-grained statistical mechanical level may contribute to resolving both this and other issues related to scaling complexity. Specifically, a re-sampling of a composite random walk at larger time lags than the micro-level unit time step for the simulation makes a Levy-look-alike step length distribution re-shaping towards a Brownian motion-like pattern. Conversely, a true Levy walk maintains its scaling characteristics upon re-sampling. This result illustrates how a confusing pattern at the mechanistic level may be resolved by changing observational scale from the micro level to the coarser statistical mechanical meso- or macro-scale. The instability of the composite random walk pattern under rescaling is a consequence of influence of the central limit theorem. I propose that a coarse-graining test studying simulated animal paths at a coarsened temporal scale by re-sampling a series should be routinely performed prior to comparing theoretical results with those patterns generated from GPS data describing animal movement paths. Fixes from terrestrial mammals are often collected at hourly intervals or larger, and such a priori coarse-grained series may thus comply better with the statistical mechanical meso- or macro-level of analysis than the behavioral mechanics observed at finer resolutions typically in the range of seconds and minutes. If fixes of real animals are collected at this high frequency, coarse graining both the simulated and real series is advised in order to bring the analysis into a temporal scale domain where analytical methods from statistical mechanics can be applied.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,APR,2013,101111j16000706201219998x,"Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway.","Gautestad, AO (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, POB 1066 Blindern, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway.",NA

production","The animal welfare issues faced by the northern Australian beef cattle industry are similar to those faced by extensive livestock production industries in other countries. However, northern Australia is characterised by climatic extremes and large areas/distances and these factors, together with low management inputs, mean that the industry faces significant challenges to assure high standards of animal welfare. In this review, the following issues are discussed: behavioural restriction; 'natural disasters'; nutrition; health; a number of aspects relating to human-animal interactions, particularly mustering (gathering/rounding up) and moving cattle, and the consequences for welfare of the timing and frequency of handling; 'surgical' procedures; identification; transportation, including live export; and predation.
The use of cattle adapted to the northern Australian environment alleviates many potential welfare problems. In addition, significant improvements to animal welfare could be made very quickly with a few straightforward management changes, such as improved planning for extended dry periods and drought; wider use of conservative stocking rates and supplementary feeding; broader implementation of vaccination programs; and greater implementation of weaner training programs. Further, a dramatic improvement for very large numbers of cattle could be made through the selection and use of polled genotypes to eliminate homed cattle.
Research from Europe suggests that current Australian recommendations for the duration of land transportation journeys may be excessive and could compromise welfare, but further research under northern Australian conditions is required. Research and development is also needed in non-invasive alternatives to castration and spaying, but in the meantime the welfare of males could be improved by castrating earlier in the animals' lives. However, it is acknowledged that this would require major changes to current cattle management practices.
Further research and development is required in relation to animal handling, and in particular the type, timing and frequency of experiences with stockpeople and also, on the assembly and sea transportation of cattle. Finally, a moral question exists as to whether cattle should continue to be exported to a particular country for which there is strong evidence of inhumane treatment.

We sought to determine whether novel acoustic and archival GPS data could be used to examine at-sea associations among grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) during the fall foraging period. Fifteen grey seals from Sable Island, Canada were deployed with Vemco Mobile Transceivers and Satellite-GPS transmitters in October 2009, 13 of which were recaptured and units retrieved 79 +/- 2.3 days later during the following breeding season, December 2009-January 2010. An association between two individuals was defined as a cluster of acoustic detections where the time between detections was <30 min. Bathymetry, travel rate, and behavioural state (slow and fast movement) were determined for each GPS archival point (3.7 +/- 0.1 locations recorded per hour). Behavioural state was estimated using a hidden Markov model. All seals had been involved in associations with other instrumented seals while at sea, with a total of 1,872 acoustic detections recorded in 201 associations. The median number of detections per association was 3 (range: 1-151) and the median duration of an association was 0.17 h (range: <0.1-11.3 h). Linear mixed-effects models showed that associations occurred when seals were exhibiting slow movement (0.24 +/- 0.01 ms(-1)) on shallow (53.4 +/- 3.7 m) offshore banks where dominant prey is known to occur.

Due to inherent difficulties while studying the behavior of these often dangerous predatory species, relatively little is known regarding their feeding behaviors and activity patterns, information that is essential to understanding their role in regulating food web dynamics and ecological processes. Here we use animal-borne imaging systems (Crittercam) to study the foraging behavior and activity patterns of a cryptic, large-bodied predator, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) in two estuaries of coastal Florida, USA. Using retrieved video data we examine the variation in foraging behaviors and activity patterns due to abiotic factors. We found the frequency of prey-attacks (mean = 0.49 prey attacks/hour) as well as the probability of prey-capture success (mean = 0.52 per attack) were significantly affected by time of day. Alligators attempted to capture prey most frequently during the night. Probability of prey-capture success per attack was highest during morning hours and sequentially lower during day, night, and sunset, respectively. Position in the water column also significantly affected prey-capture success, as individuals' experienced two-fold greater success when attacking prey while submerged. These estimates are the first for wild adult American alligators and one of the few examples for any crocodilian species worldwide. More broadly, these results reveal that our understandings of crocodilian foraging behaviors are biased due to previous studies containing limited observations of cryptic and nocturnal foraging interactions. Our results can be used to inform greater understanding regarding the top-down effects of American alligators in estuarine food webs. Additionally, our results highlight the importance and power of using animal-borne imaging when studying the behavior of elusive large-bodied, apex predators, as it provides critical insights into their trophic and behavioral interactions.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JAN 15,2014,101371journalpone0083953,"[Nifong, James C.; Silliman, Brian R.; Ferguson, Jake M.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA./[Nifong, Rachel L.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL USA./[Lowers, Russell H.] InoMed Hlth Applicat, Merritt Isl, FL USA./[Guillette, Louis J., Jr.] Med Univ Charleston South Carolina, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Charleston, SC USA./[Guillette, Louis J., Jr.] Med Univ Charleston South Carolina, Hollings Marine Lab, Charleston, SC USA./[Welsh, Matthew] Guana Tolomato Matanzas Natl Estuarine Res Reserv, Marineland, FL USA./[Abernathy, Kyler; Marshall, Greg] Natl Geog Remote Imaging, Washington, DC USA.","Nifong, JC (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0083953

However, the effects of the tag deployment procedure and tag presence on animal behavior remain poorly studied. Using affordable, custom-made animal-borne video recorders, we analyzed the seasonal activity patterns of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on a foraging ground and assessed the effects of deployment stress on turtle behavior by comparing turtle activities in 'standard' deployments (in which recording began immediately upon release, although we discarded the first 30 min of footage) with delayed-start deployments (in which recording began the following day). Turtles were more active during the warm season, spending more time swimming and surfacing, and less time resting than in the cold season. Turtles were also more likely to feed during the warm season, with all but one of the 99 observed feeding events occurring in the warm season. Turtle behavior also varied markedly between standard and delayed-start deployments. Standard deployments were dominated by swimming behavior presumably related to movement away from the capture site or exploring new habitat once a perceived safe distance away. In delayed-start deployments turtles spent less time swimming, more time resting and were more likely to feed (85 of 99 feeding events were recorded in delayed-start deployments) and engage in social interactions. The behaviors that replaced 'excess' swimming in standard deployments were season-specific. For example, in the cold season in standard deployments turtles spent a median 80% of their time swimming and 14% resting, while in delayed-start deployments these figures were effectively reversed. In the warm season, 'excess' swimming in standard deployments was replaced by feeding and other active behaviors in delayed-start deployments. These results provide a cautionary tale for the interpretation of short-term video data, demonstrating that, while 'normal' behaviors may be observed shortly after release, activity budgets can still be far from typical. Delayed-start functions or data exclusions guided by experimental research are therefore valuable to short-term biologging or biotelemetry studies. Potential effects on animal behavior from diverse animal-borne instruments, deployed for various purposes and lengths of time, warrant continued experimental attention. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pixel attributes (elevation, aspect, slope, percentage of tree cover, and distance from water, roads, and fences) failed to explain variation in pixel RT (R-2 = 0.28) regardless of PCFA. The same predictors explained most of the variation in pixel RR and RI when PCFA was high (R-2 = 0.86 and R-2 = 00.76, respectively).

By using a gyroscope, the data logger accurately reconstructed the gravity-based acceleration, 3-dimensional attitude, dynamic acceleration, and angular velocity of fish during the fast-start movement, which was impossible by previous methods using only an accelerometer and a magnetometer; these variables can therefore be used to assess the distance-related performance and manoeuverability of fish.

The system offers two different methods, firstly: access points continuously receive data about animals' location using GPS at certain time intervals and the gathered data is then classified and checked to see if there is a sudden movement (panic) of the animal groups: this method is called animal behavior classification (ABC). The second method can be defined as thermal detection (TD): the access points get the temperature values from the MBS devices and send the data to a central computer to check for instant changes in the temperatures.

Consequently, there will be strong selection pressures for the aforementioned re-orientation process when resources are sparsely distributed within unpredictable environments inhabited by correlated random walkers. This selection pressure may drive the evolution of Levy walk strategies in these landscapes. The mechanism may account for the Levy walk movement patterns of microzooplankton in the presence of mobile phytoplankton and those of a species of African jackal that scavenges within landscapes inhabited by other animal species. These findings show that Levy walks and fractal scaling do not exist outside of the correlated random-walk paradigm, as is widely thought, but are instead natural consequences of it.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,MAY,2010,101086651617,"Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.","Reynolds, AM (reprint author), Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.",10_1086_651617

In recent years computer animations have received increased attention, as this technology allows the presentation of moving stimuli that exhibit a fully standardized behaviour. However, whether simple animated 2D-still images of conspecific and heterospecific stimulus animals can elicit detailed behavioural responses in test animals is unclear thus far. In this study we validate a simple method to generate animated still images using Power Point presentations as an experimental tool. We studied context-specific behaviour directed towards conspecifics and heterospecifics, using the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher as model species. N. pulcher did not only differentiate between images of conspecifics, predators and herbivorous fish, but they also showed adequate behavioural responses towards the respective stimulus images as well as towards stimulus individuals of different sizes. Our results indicate that even simple animated still images, which can be produced with minimal technical effort at very low costs, can be used to study detailed behavioural responses towards social and predatory challenges. Thus, this technique opens up intriguing possibilities to manipulate single or multiple visual features of the presented animals by simple digital image-editing and to study their relative importance to the observing fish. We hope to encourage further studies to use animated images as a powerful research tool in behavioural and evolutionary studies.",BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,NA,2014,1011631568539X00003223,"[Fischer, Stefan; Taborsky, Barbara; Burlaud, Rebecca; Fernandez, Ahana Aurora; Hess, Sybille; Oberhummer, Evelyne; Frommen, Joachim G.] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Behav Ecol, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.","Fischer, S (reprint author), Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Behav Ecol, Wohlenstr 50a, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.",NA

Here we used light-level geolocators to study the annual migration cycle in great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), a passerine bird breeding in Eurasia and wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. We were specifically interested in seasonal strategies in routes and schedules of migration. We found that the great reed warblers (all males, no females were included) migrated from the Swedish breeding site in early August. After spending up to three weeks at scattered stopover sites in central to south-eastern Europe, they resumed migration and crossed the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara Desert without lengthy stopovers. They then spread out over a large overwintering area and each bird utilised two (or even three) main wintering sites that were spatially separated by a distinct mid-winter movement. Spring migration initiation date differed widely between individuals (1-27 April). Several males took a more westerly route over the Sahara in spring than in autumn, and in general there were fewer long-distance travels and more frequent shorter stopovers, including one in northern Africa, in spring. The shorter stopovers made spring migration on average faster than autumn migration. There was a strong correlation between the spring departure dates from wintering sites and the arrival dates at the breeding ground. All males had a high migration speed in spring despite large variation in departure dates, indicating a time-minimization strategy to achieve an early arrival at the breeding site; the latter being decisive for high reproductive success in great reed warblers. Our results have important implications for the understanding of long-distance migrants' ability to predict conditions at distant breeding sites and adapt to rapid environmental change.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,OCT 18,2013,101371journalpone0079209,"[Lemke, Hilger W.; Tarka, Maja; Bensch, Staffan; Hasselquist, Dennis; Hansson, Bengt] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Mol Ecol & Evolut Lab, Lund, Sweden./[Klaassen, Raymond H.

Such information is sparse for the Long-billed Curlew (Numenius americanus), a North American endemic shorebird of conservation concern. To test hypotheses about individual and area differences in migratory patterns across western North America, we tagged 29 curlews with satellite transmitters at breeding sites in Oregon, Nevada, and Montana. Transmissions from 28 birds for up to 4 years demonstrated that all wintered within the species' known winter range, including 9 from Oregon tracked to agricultural areas of California's Central Valley; 5 from Nevada tracked to the Central Valley, northern Gulf of California, or west coast of Baja California, Mexico; and 14 from Montana that wintered inland, from the Texas Panhandle south to the Mexican Plateau, or near the Gulf of Mexico. Montana breeders migrated east of the Rocky Mountains and traveled more than twice the distance of Oregon and Nevada breeders. Montana birds also stopped more often and longer during most passages. As a group, curlews arrived on their Oregon breeding grounds earlier than in Montana, while males preceded females in Montana and possibly Oregon. No consistent pattern emerged between sexes in departure from breeding areas, although within pairs males departed later than their mates. Individuals exhibited strong fidelity to breeding and wintering sites, and many birds showed a strong propensity for agricultural regions during winter.

Anomalous behavior detection in single-trajectory data,3732,"Huang, Hai",NA,NA,NA,"This paper presents an original approach to dynamic anomalous behavior detection in individual trajectory using a recursive Bayesian filter. The anomalous pattern detection is of great interest for navigation, driver assistance systems, surveillance as well as crisis management. In this work, we focus on the GPS trajectories of automobiles finding where the driver's behavior shows anomalies. Such anomalous behaviors can happen in many cases, especially when the driver encounters orientation problems, i.e., taking a wrong turn, performing a detour, or losing the way. First, three high-level features, i.e., turns and their density, detour factor, and route repetition are extracted from the given trajectory geometry, for which a long-term perspective is required to observe data sequences of a significant length instead of individual time stamps. We therefore employ high-order Markov chains with a dynamic memory' to model the trajectory integrating these long-term features. The Markov model is processed by a proposed recursive Bayesian filter to infer an optimal probability distribution of the potential anomalous driving behaviors dynamically over time. The filter performs unsupervised detection in single trajectories based on local features only. No training process is required to characterize the anomalous behaviors. By analyzing the detection results of individual trajectories, collective behaviors can be derived indicating traffic issues such as congestions and turn restrictions. Experiments are performed on volunteered geographic information (VGI) data, self-acquired trajectories, and open trajectory datasets to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.",NA,DEC 2,2015,1.01080136588162E+024,NA,NA,10_1080_13658816_2015_1063640

In practice, the movement is quantified by observing relatively few individuals, and averaging to estimate the rate of dispersal of the population as a whole. Here, we show that this can lead to serious errors in the predicted movement of the population if the individuals disperse at different rates. We develop a stochastic model for the diffusion of heterogeneous populations, inspired by the movement of the parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. Direct observations of this nematode in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments reveal a large variation in individual behaviour within the population as reflected initially in the speed of the movement. Further statistical analysis shows that the movement is characterized by temporal correlations and in a heterogeneously structured environment the correlations that occur are of shorter range compared with those in a homogeneous environment. Therefore, by using the first-order correlated random walk techniques, we derive an effective diffusion coefficient for each individual, and show that there is a significant variation in this parameter among the population that follows a gamma distribution. Based on these findings, we build a new dispersal model in which we maintain the classical assumption that individual movement can be described by normal diffusion, but due to the variability in individual dispersal rates, the diffusion coefficient is not constant at the population level and follows a continuous distribution. The conclusions and methodology presented are relevant to any heterogeneous population of individuals with widely different diffusion rates.",ROYAL SOC,JAN 6,2009,101098rsif20080261,"[Hapca, Simona; Crawford, John W.; Young, Iain M.] Univ Abertay Dundee, SIMBIOS Ctr, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland.","Hapca, S (reprint author), Univ Abertay Dundee, SIMBIOS Ctr, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland.",2610328

A downside of behavioural conformism is that it may decrease the group's responsiveness to external information. Combining experiment and theory, we show how ants optimize collective transport. On the single-ant scale, optimization stems from decision rules that balance individuality and compliance. Macroscopically, these rules poise the system at the transition between random walk and ballistic motion where the collective response to the steering of a single informed ant is maximized. We relate this peak in response to the divergence of susceptibility at a phase transition. Our theoretical models predict that the ant-load system can be transitioned through the critical point of this mesoscopic system by varying its size; we present experiments supporting these predictions.

We placed GPS collars on captive grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and observed their behavior while the collars attempted to obtain locations. Bear behavior influenced indices of GPS signal attenuation, the angle of the GPS antenna to the horizon, and collar height above the ground, but because bears sometimes rotate their collars, antenna angle varied within a behavior, particularly when collars fit snugly. We used a model selection approach to evaluate the influence of the angle of the GPS antenna to the horizon, collar height above the ground, and bear behavior on fix success. The model with both antenna angle and collar height was most parsimonious. We recommend fitting GPS collars such that the GPS antenna is opposite the battery pack (i.e., oriented up) for greatest fix success. Because collars sometimes rotate, sensors recording the antenna's angle to the horizon and bear height would help researchers model missed fixes related to signal attenuation caused by behavior. Although captive bear behavior may differ from wild bears, we provide a first look at the relative influences of antenna angle, antenna height, and bear behavior. When antenna angle and height information is not available, using activity sensors and bear movement rates to identify resting behavior should be considered to reduce bias in habitat analyses of GPS collar data.",INT ASSOC BEAR RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT-IBA,NA,2013,102192URSUSD11000251,"[Graves, Tabitha A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA./[Fortin, Jennifer K.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA./[Fortin, Jennifer K.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA./[Branan, Matthew A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Stat, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.","Graves, TA (reprint author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, JVK Wagar 201, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",NA

A sex pheromone-like stimulant derived from adult virgin females and artificially synthesized limonene were used as attractive and aversive odor sources, respectively. When a searching animal was stimulated with the attractive female-derived odor, the horizontal deflections of both the antennae were increased, and in most cases the vertical antennal positions were shifted downward. The stimulation also significantly decreased the walking speed of the animal. These behavioral changes imply a careful search in the immediate surroundings. The aftereffect of the sex pheromone was more pronounced on locomotion than on antennal movement. On the other hand, stimulation with the aversive odor (limonene) tended to suppress active antennal movement, and also increased the walking speed. Immediately after the withdrawal of the aversive odor, the active movement of the antennae was resumed, and the walking speed rapidly decreased to a level approximately the same as that of the control period. These results indicate that the responses to the qualitatively opposite types of odor are reciprocal to each other with regard to both antennal movement and locomotion.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,SEP,2007,101007s0035900702493,"Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Sch Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.","Okada, J (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Sch Sci, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",10_1007_s00359_007_0249_3

Ezenwa, Vanessa O.",NA,NA,NA,"Social, ecological and environmental factors all influence how much time animals allocate to different behaviours. Here, we investigated whether parasites affect behavioural time allocation in a free-ranging ungulate that must apportion time to multiple competing activities crucial for maintenance, survival and reproduction. We examined how experimental removal of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes influenced the relative amounts of time that female Grant's gazelle, Nanger granti, allocated to core behaviours including foraging, vigilance, moving and resting. The anthelmintic treatment reduced female parasite load for similar to 120 days, and during this period, females relieved of their parasitic nematodes adjusted their daily time budgets. At the group level, parasite removal resulted in an increase in foraging time and a decrease in vigilance. This effect was also apparent at the individual level, where treated females allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. In addition to treatment, group size was a significant predictor of the relative time spent foraging versus vigilant, where females in larger groups allocated more time to foraging at the expense of vigilance. Our results suggest that parasites may induce changes in host behaviour that are of similar magnitude to some of the most commonly studied social drivers of behavioural time allocation.

Among these anthropogenic uses, the seasonal increment in the pressure due to leisure activities such as coastal tourism and yachting is an important environmental stressor in many coastal zones. These pressures may elicit understudied impacts due to, for example, sunscreens or other seasonal pollutants. The island of Majorca, northwest Mediterranean Sea, experiences one of the highest number of tourist visits per capita in the world, thus the surrounding coastal habitat is subject to high anthropogenic seasonal stress. Studies on early stages of fishes have observed responses to coastal chemical cues for the selection or avoidance of habitats. However, the potential interferences of human impacts on these signals are largely unknown. A choice chamber was used to determine water type preference and behaviour in naive settled juvenile gilt-head sea bream (Sparus aurata), a temperate species of commercial interest. Fish were tested individually for behavioural changes with respect to water types from potential beneficial habitats, such as seawater with extract of the endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica, anthropogenically influenced habitats such as water extracted from a commercial and recreational harbour and seawater mixed with sunscreen at concentrations observed in coastal waters. Using a Bayesian approach, we investigated a) water type preference; b) mean speed; and c) variance in the movement (as an indicator of burst swimming activity, or ""sprint"" behaviour) as behavioural descriptors with respect to water type. Fish spent similar percentage of time in treatment and control water types. However, movement descriptors showed that fish in sunscreen water moved slower (98.43% probability of being slower) and performed fewer sprints (90.1% probability of having less burst in speed) compared to control water. Less evident increases in sprints were observed in harbour water (73.56% more sprints), and seagrass (79.03% more) in comparison to control water. When seagrass water was tested against harbour water, the latter elicited a higher number of sprints (91.66% increase). We show that juvenile gilt-head seabream are able to react to a selection of naturally occurring chemically different odourscapes, including the increasingly important presence of sunscreen products, and provide a plausible interpretation of the observed behavioural patterns.

Our objectives were to assess (1) the characteristics of foraging substrates used by woodpeckers, (2) whether birds foraged according to the availability of high-quality foraging substrates found at varying distances from edges and (3) to characterize the movement patterns of foraging individuals near clear-cut boundaries. Behavioural observations of individuals allowed us to characterize all trees used for foraging according to their DBH, decay state, bark cover, tree species and top condition. We also georeferenced those trees, which allowed us to determine their distance from the edge and the orientation of the bird movements with regards to the edge. We sampled snags and downed woody debris along 80 m line transects that were oriented perpendicularly to the edge. Our results show that woodpeckers foraged in a relatively high proportion of live trees (35%). For live trees, woodpeckers used trees of larger diameter and black spruce was underused with regards to its availability. Among snags, woodpeckers preferred snags with a larger diameter, a lower decay class and a higher bark cover than nearest available snags. The density of high-quality foraging substrates (large recently dead trees) increased near the edge and decreased as we got farther into the forest interior. When comparing the distribution of used foraging snags with the one of available high-quality foraging substrates, our results show that these two distributions are significantly different. High-quality substrates located at 40 m or less from an edge were used less frequently than their availability. Hence, we can conclude that foraging woodpeckers can use snags near edges but are less prone to use these foraging trees even though they become more available than in the interior of remnant stands of managed forests. Nevertheless, bird movements were oriented parallel to the edge as far as 80 m away from the clear-cut boundary. Considering the under-utilisation of high-quality substrates near edges, we suggest that foraging substrate availability cannot explain the results obtained; the hypothesis that edges are acting as movement conduits likely explain woodpecker movement patterns we observed. Finally, the retention of larger tracks of mature and overmature forests would reduce the amount of edge habitat and provide better foraging conditions for American three-toed woodpecker in extensively managed landscapes.

However, consequences for survival and reproductive success are difficult to ascertain. Using a series of laboratory-based experiments and an open-water test with the same methodology, we show that acoustic disturbance can compromise antipredator behaviour - which directly affects survival likelihood - and explore potential underlying mechanisms. Juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) exposed to additional noise (playback of recordings of ships passing through harbours), rather than control conditions (playback of recordings from the same harbours without ships), performed less well in two simulated predation paradigms. Eels were 50% less likely and 25% slower to startle to an ambush predator' and were caught more than twice as quickly by a pursuit predator'. Furthermore, eels experiencing additional noise had diminished spatial performance and elevated ventilation and metabolic rates (indicators of stress) compared with control individuals.

We hypothesized that dingoes, being of domestic origin, would be adaptable to anthropogenic resource subsidies and that their space use would be affected by the dispersion of those resources. We tested this by analyzing Resource Selection Functions (RSFs) developed from GPS fixes (locations) of dingoes in arid central Australia. Using Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models (GLMMs), we investigated resource relationships for dingoes that had access to abundant food near mine facilities, and for those that did not. From these models, we predicted the probability of dingo occurrence in relation to anthropogenic resource subsidies and other habitat characteristics over similar to 18,000 km(2). Very small standard errors and subsequent pervasively high P-values of results will become more important as the size of data sets, such as our GPS tracking logs, increases. Therefore, we also investigated methods to minimize the effects of serial and spatio-temporal correlation among samples and unbalanced study designs. Using GLMMs, we accounted for some of the correlation structure of GPS animal tracking data; however, parameter standard errors remained very small and all predictors were highly significant. Consequently, we developed an alternative approach that allowed us to review effect sizes at different spatial scales and determine which predictors were sufficiently ecologically meaningful to include in final RSF models. We determined that the most important predictor for dingo occurrence around mine sites was distance to the refuse facility. Away from mine sites, close proximity to human-provided watering points was predictive of dingo dispersion as were other landscape factors including palaeochannels, rocky rises and elevated drainage depressions. Our models demonstrate that anthropogenically supplemented food and water can alter dingo-resource relationships. The spatial distribution of such resources is therefore critical for the conservation and management of dingoes and other top predators.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 30,2013,101371journalpone0063931,"[Newsome, Thomas M.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia./[Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Canberra, Invas Anim Cooperat Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia./[Ballard, Guy-Anthony] Univ New England, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Armidale, NSW, Australia./[Fleming, Peter J.

This research often ignores behavioral variation in response to temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions around an unchanging mean environment. In this study we evaluate the effects of temporal fluctuations in predation risk (predator cue concentration of Procambarus spp.), without the confounding effects of a changing mean, on among-individual variation in anti-predator behavior in freshwater snails (Physa acuta). We also evaluate how the interaction between environmental and individual variation affects snail survival and reproduction by exposing snails to lethal predators following the behavioral assays. Our analyses revealed a trend towards higher among-individual variation in mean behavior when snails were exposed to intermediate levels of environmental variation compared to highly variable or constant environments. However, because of large uncertainty in estimates of among-individual variation, differences among treatments were indistinguishable from noise for most, but not all behaviors. In the lethal predator trials, snail survival and time to mortality was the lowest in the high variation environment. Also, as environmental variation increased snail egg production decreased and snails laid more of their eggs underneath a provided shelter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In general, anticipation occurs when an event is being predicted. Anticipatory behavior is defined by Spruijt et al. as responses elicited by rewarding stimuli that lead to and facilitate consummatory behavior (Spruijt et al., 2001, Appl Anim Behav Sci 72: 145-171). Using behavioral recording techniques, the behaviors, breathing rates, space use, and activity levels of all dolphins was recorded both before and after shows. Analysis compared pre- and post-show data in addition to looking at gradual changes in behavior prior to show sessions. Significant changes were found in the behavior and space use prior to sessions with the dolphins decreasing their activity levels, spending more time at the surface and moving towards the starting point of a session before it took place. There was a significant increase in the vigilant behavior before sessions, indicating that the dolphins were becoming more alert towards their trainers and other activities around the pool. This result mirrors previous research with other captive species; as feeding time was approaching, the animals seemed to wait and look for the handlers. Any behavioral change that may be regarded as anticipatory behavior was not evidently abnormal or stereotypic in nature, and breathing rates remained stable indicating that the animals do not perceive the shows as stressful or as an aversive experience. Additionally, behavior and level of activity remained stable following the sessions.

As predicted, great tits that foraged close to the ground moved uphill, whereas blue tits foraging in the tree canopy did not. The Earth is not flat but few have studied antipredator behavior in hilly landscapes. We think the main reason is lack of theory and testable predictions.Few studies have reported flight responses of prey on landscape slopes in the wild, and little theoretical work is available. We present a formal model to predict whether prey should move up or down the hillside after detecting a perched raptor as determined by the duration of the attack once launched by the predator, perching height of the predator, and the landscape slope. We recorded escape responses of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major when approached by a human in the field. This was done in the postfledging period, when the demand for food is high, and when the families usually move to a new site, presumably perceived to be safer, to continue foraging after being exposed to a predator. We found that great tit families, which prefer to forage close to the ground, flew uphill, matching the model's prediction. However, blue tit families, which forage higher in the canopy, did not move uphill but moved higher up in the trees. Vertical movement upward may be the safest option if the predator is located on the ground. Modeling escape flights may encourage detailed studies of attack and escape behaviors in animals and provide insights in predator-prey interactions in general.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,MAR-APR,2014,101093behecoaru003,"[Slagsvold, Tore; Husek, Jan; Whittington, Jason D.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway./[Husek, Jan] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, NO-2480 Koppang, Norway./[Wiebe, Karen L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.","Slagsvold, T (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway.",NA

Franks, Nigel R.",NA,NA,NA,"To find useful work to do for their colony, individual eusocial animals have to move, somehow staying attentive to relevant social information. Recent research on individual Temnothorax albipennis ants moving inside their colony's nest found a power- law relationship between a movement's duration and its average speed; and a universal speed profile for movements showing that they mostly fluctuate around a constant average speed. From this predictability it was inferred that movement durations are somehow determined before the movement itself. Here, we find similar results in lone T. albipennis ants exploring a large arena outside the nest, both when the arena is clean and when it contains chemical information left by previous nest- mates. This implies that these movement characteristics originate from the same individual neural and/or physiological mechanism(s), operating without immediate regard to social influences. However, the presence of pheromones and/or other cues was found to affect the inter- event speed correlations. Hence we suggest that ants' motor planning results in intermittent response to the social environment: movement duration is adjusted in response to social information only between movements, not during them. This environmentally flexible, intermittently responsive movement behaviour points towards a spatially allocated division of labour in this species. It also prompts more general questions on collective animal movement and the role of intermittent causation from higher to lower organizational levels in the stability of complex systems.",NA,JAN,2016,101098rsos150534,NA,NA,4736936

Strategies for the conservation of large-sized animal species with large home ranges have included the creation of large protected areas, or for migrants, the creation of protected breeding, stop-over and wintering areas. We aim to describe the movement behaviour of Andean condors (Vulturgryphus), and to relate it to its significance in the conservation of this species and its environment. We examine whether current conservation strategies are sufficient to ensure the daily requirements of the species, and evaluate the degree to which breeding and foraging areas are covered by protected areas. We present as a new challenge the conservation of large-sized species that perform daily long-range movements across a number of political and ecological borders. Andean condors tagged with GPS-satellite transmitters make long daily flights from their breeding areas (mountains in Argentina and Chile) to their feeding areas (the steppe in Argentina) crossing over the Andean Cordillera. These flights demonstrate that current conservation strategies are insufficient to protect species with such daily movement patterns, and that new approaches are needed. Thus, it is necessary to gain a more in-depth knowledge of the movement ecology of these organisms through individual-level approaches integrating intrinsic (reproductive and foraging behaviour) and extrinsic (political and geomorphological boundaries) factors that shape movement patterns. Conservation efforts must include international cooperation aiming to combine the conservation of flagship species, the management of public and private lands, and the maintenance of valuable ecosystem services.

Methods included the live-trapping of mice, estimation of worm burdens by faecal analysis, administration of either an anthelminthic or water (as a control) and the radio-tracking of selected animals.
Heligmosomoides polygyrus showed an overdispersed distribution pattern, with prevalence tending to be higher in males and heavier mice. Prevalence and intensity peaked in spring and declined in autumn both in the entire population and in adults. This seasonality in the arable ecosystem in comparison to woodland may arise due to the direct and indirect impact of agricultural practice.
To investigate the link between infection and movements, radio-tracked mice were classed as either 'Uninfected' or 'Infected'; mice were also classed as either 'Control' or 'Dosed'. There were no significant differences in movement parameters between 'Infected/Dosed' and 'Infected/ Control', possibly because treatment was not administered sufficiently frequently. Both 'Infected' classes of mice moved significantly faster than 'Uninfected' ones, and 'Infected/ Dosed' mice moved significantly further than 'Uninfected' ones. The percentage of time spent moving was also greater, and the home range area was larger, for 'Infected/Dosed' and 'Infected/ Control' than for 'Uninfected' mice. The observed differences in movement may have been the result of either the behaviour of mice influencing their parasite load or the parasite manipulating its host.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,DEC,1994,101111j146979981994tb04869x,"UNIV OXFORD,DEPT ZOOL,WILDLIFE CONSERVAT RES UNIT,OXFORD OX1 3PS,ENGLAND.",NA,NA

Others, however, have suggested that animal movement is ill fit by PL distributions or contend a state-switching process better explains apparent Levy flight movement patterns. We used a mix of direct behavioural observations and GPS tracking to understand step-length patterns in females of two related butterflies. We initially found movement in one species (Euphydryas editha taylori) was best fit by a bounded PL, evidence of a Levy flight, while the other (Euphydryas phaeton) was best fit by an exponential distribution. Subsequent analyses introduced additional candidate models and used behavioural observations to sort steps based on intraspecific interactions (interactions were rare in E. phaeton but common in E. e. taylori). These analyses showed a mixed-exponential is favoured over the bounded PL for E. e. taylori and that when step-lengths were sorted into states based on the influence of harassing conspecific males, both states were best fit by simple exponential distributions. The direct behavioural observations allowed us to infer the underlying behavioural mechanism is a state-switching process driven by intraspecific interactions rather than a Levy flight.",ROYAL SOC,FEB 6,2015,101098rsif20140927,"[Breed, Greg A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada./[Severns, Paul M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Bot & Plant Pathol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA./[Edwards, Andrew M.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Marine Ecosyst & Aquaculture Div, Nanaimo, BC V9T 6N7, Canada.","Breed, GA (reprint author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",NA

Five cameras recorded video and audio and associated GPS locations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) activities during 20 weeks from March to July 2011, although the units can run for >36 weeks depending on the rate of data collection.

However, inclusion of activity sensors in many GPS collars also grants the potential to remotely estimate behavioral state. Thus, only using GPS collars to collect location data belies their full capabilities. Coupling behavioral state with location data would allow researchers and managers to refine habitat selection models by using diel behavioral state changes to partition fine-scale temporal shifts in habitat selection. We tested the capability of relatively unsophisticated GPS-collar activity sensors to estimate behavior throughout diel periods using free-ranging female elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico, USA, 2013-2014. Collars recorded cumulative number of movements (hits) per 15-min recording period immediately preceding GPS fixes at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 hr. We measured diel behavioral patterns of focal elk, categorizing active (i.e., foraging, traveling, vigilant, grooming) and inactive (i.e., resting) states. Active behaviors (foraging, traveling) produced more average hits (0.87 +/- 0.69 hits/min, 4.0 +/- 2.2 hits/min, respectively; 95% CI) and inactive (resting) behavior fewer hits (-1.1 +/- 0.61 95% CI). We differentiated active and inactive behavioral states with a bootstrapped threshold of 5.9 +/- 3.9 hits/15-min recording period. Mean cumulative activity-sensor hits corresponded with observed diel behavioral patterns: hits increased during crepuscular (0600, 1800 hr) observations when elk were most active (0000-0600 hr: d = 0.19; 1200-1800 hr: d = 0.64) and decreased during midday and night (0000 hr, 1200 hr) when elk were least active (1800-0000 hr: d = -0.39; 0600-1200 hr: d = -0.43). Even using relatively unsophisticated GPS-collar activity sensors, managers can remotely estimate behavioral states, approximate diel behavioral patterns, and potentially complement location data in developing habitat selection models.

By utilizing GPS tracking, activity sensors, body temperature (T-b) recordings, change-point analysis (CPA), home range, habitat and dietary analyses, as well as fatty acid signatures (FAS), the impact of the species on wintertime food webs was assessed. The timing of passive bouts was determined with multiple methods and compared to T-b data analyzed by CPA.
Results: Raccoon dogs displayed wintertime mobility, and the home range sizes determined by GPS were similar or larger than previous estimates by radio tracking. The preferred habitats were gardens, shores, deciduous forests, and sparsely forested areas. Fields had close to neutral preference; roads and railroads were utilized as travel routes. Raccoon dogs participated actively in the food web and gained benefit from human activity. Mammals, plants, birds, and discarded fish comprised the most important dietary classes, and the consumption of fish could be detected in FAS. Ambient temperature was an important external factor influencing Tb and activity. The timing of passive periods approximated by behavioral data and by CPA shared 91% similarity.
Conclusions: Passive periods can be determined with CPA from Tb recordings without the previously used time-consuming and expensive methods. It would be possible to recruit more animals by using the simple methods of data loggers and ear tags. Hunting could be used as a tool to return the ear-tagged individuals allowing the economical extension of follow-up studies. The Tb and CPA methods could be applied to other northern carnivores.",BMC,DEC 13,2012,1.01186147267851E+017,"[Mustonen, Anne-Mari; Nieminen, Petteri] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Inst Biomed Anat, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland./[Mustonen, Anne-Mari; Ikonen, Katri; Asikainen, Juha; Nieminen, Petteri] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Sci & Forestry, Dept Biol, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland./[Lempiaeinen, Terttu] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Botan Museum, FI-20014 Turku, Finland./[Aspelund, Mikko] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Sci & Forestry, Dept Phys & Math, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland./[Hellstedt, Paavo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland./[Itaemies, Juhani] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Zool Museum, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland./[Vaehae, Ville; Erkinaro, Jaakko] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland./[Kunnasranta, Mervi] Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FI-20520 Turku, Finland./[Aho, Jari] Municipal Vet Clin Joensuu, FI-80110 Joensuu, Finland.","Mustonen, AM (reprint author), Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Med, Inst Biomed Anat, POB 1627, FI-70211 Kuopio, Finland.",10_1186_1472_6785_12_27

Individuals or pairs were observed in shallow water (< 5 m). Their locations were recorded on maps of each study reef. The Animal Movement Analysis Extension (AMAE) in ArcView was used to plot territory borders and compute territory size for each species. Chaetodon austriacus, a generalist corallivore that exploited evenly distributed food resources, maintained small exclusive pair territories with clearly defined territory boundaries. In contrast, C. trifascialis, a specialist corallivore that exploited patchily distributed food resources, demonstrated considerable variation in territorial behaviour that ranged from the defence of small exclusive solitary territories to the shared use of a large home range.

Objective The aim of this review was to systematically review the use of GPS and microsensor technology to quantify player activity profiles in match-play, and conduct a meta-analysis of relevant movement variables in order to present the contemporary and emerging themes within rugby league.
Methods A systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, and Google Scholar) from the earliest record to February 2015 was conducted. Permutations of key words included GPS, microtechnology, activity profiles, match demands (movement or physical demands), and rugby league. A meta-analysis was conducted to provide a pooled mean and confidence intervals on comparable data from at least three studies.
Results Twenty-seven studies met the eligibility criteria and included 1270 male participants. The studies reported on GPS use in elite competition (n = 16) with limited representation of other competition standards: sub-elite (n = 6), amateur (n = 1) and junior (n = 3). All studies reported on movement variables (distance, relative distance, speed and accelerations), with studies analysing movement at high speed (n = 18, 66.7 %), evaluating collision or impact variables (n = 15, 55.6 %) and determining the metabolic energy (n = 2, 7.4 %) associated with rugby league match-play. Activity profiles of varying positions, positional groups and levels of rugby league competition were described. Meta-analysis indicated that the total distance covered by backs and adjustables were both greater than forward positions, but adjustables covered greater relative distance than forwards and backs. Speed zones were typically categorised into six speed zones ranging from 0 to 36 km center dot h(-1), or into low-and high-intensity movement. Vast inconsistencies were apparent across studies in categorising movement at high speed, posing difficulties for comparison. Meta-analysis indicated that, although the number of repeated high-intensity effort (RHIE) bouts in elite players were similar to sub-elite (and both greater than juniors), the number of efforts per RHIE were significantly greater in elite than sub-elite players. Differential pacing strategies were adopted according to player selection (whole-match vs. interchange), time period within match-play and match outcome, in order to maintain high-intensity performance or to challenge for a win. Sizeable inconsistencies were also identified in the definitions of reported collisions (classified as mild, moderate and heavy) and impacts (six zone categories provided by manufacturer), making comparisons across studies difficult. Collision profiles were different between competition standard and position where elite players and forwards sustained more moderate-and high-intensity collisions than sub-elite players and backs, respectively. The recent inclusion of GPS-derived metabolic indices to activity profiles has also accentuated the distinctive workloads of positional groups during match-play where adjustables demonstrate the highest energy expenditure and metabolic power.
Conclusions This review and the results of the meta-analysis have demonstrated that positional groups have varied kinematic and metabolic demands. During match play, forwards sustain the greatest number of collisions and RHIE bouts, outside backs participate in more high-speed running and cover the greatest distance, and adjustables work at high intensity covering the greatest relative distance with the highest metabolic cost. Therefore, specific training for each positional group should address their match requirements. In addition, sub-elite players exhibit lower intensity of play compared with elite players, as indicated by lower relative distance and less number of efforts per RHIE bout despite similarities in total distance covered and number of RHIE bouts. To prepare them for elite-level play, their training should incorporate higher intensity drills in which greater relative distance and number of efforts per RHIE bout are performed. Furthermore, the lack of consistency in the definition of speed zones, high-intensity movement, collisions and impacts, underscores the difficulties encountered in meaningful comparisons of player activity profiles between studies. Consensus of these definitions would facilitate direct comparisons within rugby league.",ADIS INT LTD,APR,2016,101007s4027901504406,"[Hausler, Joanne; Halaki, Mark; Orr, Rhonda] Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Discipline Exercise & Sport Sci, 75 East St, Sydney, NSW 2141, Australia.","Orr, R (reprint author), Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Discipline Exercise & Sport Sci, 75 East St, Sydney, NSW 2141, Australia.",10_1007_s40279_015_0440_6

In this study, we have refined the NaLA calculation model for application to drift gill nets by introducing additional gear components besides netting and by considering environmental factors, such as waves. The primary objective of this paper was to evaluate the utility of the refined system and examine how accurately it simulates the actual behaviour of a drift gill net by comparing the predictions with measured data. Ten observations to obtain in situ data were recorded between May and June 2003 while assessing salmonid and other pelagic fish stocks in the northwest Pacific. During these operations, the horizontal and vertical displacements of the net were measured using mobile GPS and depth sensors over 10 h soak times. Then, the simulated results of the shape and motion of the gear were compared with the measured horizontal and vertical displacements. There was close agreement between the simulated and measured behaviour of the gear, and we proved that the refined NaLA method can simulate the shape and motion of an actual drift gill net with good accuracy, if the field conditions are accurately input to the calculation.

Gabriel, Kelley Pettee
Kohl, Harold Willis, III",NA,NA,NA,"Background
The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is a successful framework for guiding behavior change programs for several health behaviors, yet its application to reduce of sedentary behavior has been neglected. In addition, no data exist regarding the association between determinants of sedentary behaviors based on the TTM and physical activity behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate college students' stages of motivational readiness to avoid sedentary behaviors and relevant psychological determinants using newly developed TTM questionnaires and to identify the association between current physical activity and sedentary behaviors based on TTM constructs.
Methods
Data were obtained from 225 college students enrolled in health education and physical education courses. Participants completed a package of questionnaires including validated TTM, physical activity and sitting time questionnaires. Participants also wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. MANOVAs were conducted to determine mean differences in psychological constructs across the TTM stages, and Chi-square tests and Spearman correlation were used to evaluate the associations between current physical activity and sedentary behavior.
Results
A majority of the participants were in the sedentary stages, and men and women differed in proportion of individuals in the stages (78.0% vs. 68.1%, respectively). The gender difference was also found in use of the processes of change. In general, the mean scores of the TTM constructs increased as the stages progressed. No significant associations were found between the TTM constructs for sedentary behavior and current physical activity levels (p>0.05).
Conclusions
A high proportion of college students were in sedentary stages regardless of physical activity levels, but different distributions in men and women. Participants in earlier stages were less likely to utilize the TTM constructs to reduce sedentary behaviors than those in later stages. A lack of association between physical activity and the psychological determinants of sedentary behavior was found.",NA,APR 27,2017,101371journalpone0176330,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0176330

By combining such data with information on foraging and ranging behavior of nonhuman primates, one can analyze the influence of resource distribution on social organization and group cohesion. We investigated the abilities of a three-channel GPS receiver to collect location data under varying canopy densities in both temperate and tropical forests. Eighty randomly selected points were sampled in a beech-maple forest in northeast Ohio, USA; 65 points also were sampled at several tropical forests in Costa Rica and Trinidad. At each point we attempted to obtain a GPS position fix; we also determined the speed of satellite acquisition and measured canopy density using a spherical densiometer. The ability to obtain a reading differed greatly between the two forest types (chi(2) = 53.79, P < 0.001). Ninety-seven percent of all attempts were successful in the temperate forest, whereas only a 34% acquisition rate was obtained in the tropical forests. Logistic regression showed that the probability of obtaining a reading in Neotropical forests was 75% but only when canopy cover was less than 20%. Thus, these minimal-channel GPS units may be of limited utility for behavioral ecologists working in closed-canopy Neotropical forests.

Aims. The present study aimed to describe the most important characteristics of landscape use by feral cats on a large, human-populated island, and to use this information to guide the development of feral-cat management programs.
Methods. We used GPS tracking collars to record the movements of 13 feral cats at two sites on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, for between 20 and 106 days. We described home-range extents by using local convex hulls, and derived management suggestions from examination of home-range and movement data.
Key results. Median feral-cat home range was 5.11 km(2), and this did not differ between sexes or sites. Cats at a fragmented pastoral site tended to favour woody vegetation over open paddocks, but habitat preferences were less clear at a bushland site. Cats that preferentially used treelines at the pastoral site were almost twice as likely to be recorded close to a tree-line junction as expected.
Conclusions. Control programs for feral cats on Kangaroo Island should deploy control devices at a density no less than 1.7 devices km(-2). Spatial coverage should be as large as practicable or repeated frequently. Infrequent programs covering small areas can be expected only to provide short-term reductions in cat abundance.
Implications. The information gained from the present study will contribute to the development of strategic sustained management plans for feral cats on Kangaroo Island.

To interpret spatial utilisation distributions, there is a need to translate animal locations obtained from global positioning system (GPS) telemetry into the activities performed and, hence, benefits derived, from particular places and times of day. Derived activity patterns also reveal how animals cope in changing environmental conditions.
Aim. The aim of our research was to develop and test an objective, consistent and biologically faithful method for deriving activity states from movement rates between successive GPS locations.
Methods. The method entails fitting mixtures of component statistical distributions to the frequency distribution of hourly step displacements. Breakpoints indicating transitions between predominant movement modes were identified by fitting exponential segments. Breakpoints were incorporated as off-sets for gamma distributions, but not needed for log-normal distributions. This procedure was applied to movement data for three large grazing ungulates.
Key results. Models consistently distinguished four movement modes interpreted as representing resting, foraging, mixed movement and travelling activity. Breakpoints and parameter estimates were consistent among seasons and herds of each ungulate species. The exponential-segment model and both mixture models closely represented observed daily activity patterns. However, some adjustment of the derived time budgets was needed to be consistent with observations.
Key conclusions. Mixture models provide an objective, reliable and biologically meaningful procedure for assessing seasonal, annual and spatial variation in the activity patterns of large ungulates from GPS data.

J.",IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,MODIS TIME-SERIES; HUMAN-SETTLEMENTS; CLASSIFICATION,Nonlinear detection; remote sensing; time series,"In this paper, we propose a new method for extracting features from time-series satellite data to detect land cover change. We propose to make use of the behavior of a deterministic nonlinear system driven by a time-dependent force. The driving force comprises a set of concatenated model parameters regressed from fitting a model to a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer time series. The goal is to create behavior in the nonlinear deterministic system, which appears predictable for the time series undergoing no change, while erratic for the time series undergoing land cover change. The differential equation used for the deterministic nonlinear system is that of a largeamplitude pendulum, where the displacement angle is observed over time. If there has been no change in the land cover, the mean driving force will approximate zero, and hence the pendulum will behave as if in free motion under the influence of gravity only. If, however, there has been a change in the land cover, this will for a brief initial period introduce a nonzero mean driving force, which does work on the pendulum, changing its energy and future evolution, which we demonstrate is observable. This we show is sufficient to introduce an observable change to the state of the pendulum, thus enabling change detection. We extend this method to a higher dimensional differential equation to improve the false alarm rate in our experiments. Numerical results show a change detection accuracy of nearly 96% when detecting new human settlements, with a corresponding false alarm rate of 0.2% (omission error rate of 4%). This compares very favorably with other published methods, which achieved less than 90% detection but with false alarm rates all above 9% (omission error rate of 66%).",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,DEC,2017,101109TGRS20172743218,"[Salmon, B.

In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish (n = 28), great barracuda (n = 2) and permit (n = 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two steelhead kelts (J and M) with archival tags were recovered at the hatchery after 219 and 285 days at liberty respectively. Based on changes in geolocations, vertical movements, and water temperatures, the migrations of steelhead J and M were divided into five and six phases respectively. Steelhead J moved into coastal California waters while steelhead M remained in freshwater for the majority of its time at liberty. Large increases in temperature and opacity were recorded before and after the ocean phases, likely as the steelhead moved through the Sacramento Delta. Both steelhead kelts remained relatively close to the surface throughout their migration but there were diurnal differences in the vertical movements. In freshwater, the steelhead tended to be deeper during the day (e.g., steelhead J: 3.08 +/- 1.50 vs 1.65 +/- 1.15 m, day vs night) but in the ocean, the steelhead were typically deeper during the night (1.32 +/- 1.61 vs 5.63 +/- 6.11 m). Both steelhead kelts appeared to be less oceanic than a previous study in Scott Creek, a small coastal stream approximately 100 km south of the mouth of San Francisco Bay. Although this study has a small sample size, the results suggest that steelhead kelts from a large river and estuary system, like the Sacramento River, may be relatively less oceanic than steelhead kelts from small coastal streams.",SPRINGER,FEB,2013,101007s1064101199384,"[Teo, Steven L.

Therefore, quantifying their activity at an individual level is important in further understanding how they structure marine communities. Sea stars are difficult to tag, so there is little information on activity of sea stars in their natural environment over extended periods of days to weeks. We tagged the New Zealand sea star Coscinasterias muricata with small archival electronic tags that recorded water temperate and depth every 5 min for up to 2 weeks. The tagging was undertaken to test the viability of using electronic tags in research on the ecology of the sea stars in a New Zealand fiord, where their vertical distribution is influenced by the presence of low-salinity layers. The effects of the tagging were tested in the laboratory and in the field, with tagging having no detectable influence on in vitro survival, feeding rate, and righting time, or on their in situ movement and depth distribution. Laboratory experiments testing the salinity tolerance of C muricata showed they could tolerate salinities as low as 25 PSU for at least a 20-day period. Tagging of sea stars in their natural environment provided information on depth distributions, vertical migrations and the influence of the physical environment on their behaviour. The tagging also revealed a large variation in activity at the individual level. This study represents one of the first to utilise electronic tagging to study the ecology of a mobile invertebrate such as a sea star. The success of this initial study suggests that we could gain valuable quantitative insight into the ecology of these animals in future tag deployments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about the species' movements and distribution during the nine month non-breeding period (September-May), when changes in sea ice extent and composition are also occurring and predicted to continue. To examine bird movements and the seasonal role of sea ice to non-breeding Mandt's black guillemots, we deployed and recovered (n = 45) geolocators on individuals at a breeding colony in Arctic Alaska during 2011-2015. Black guillemots moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas immediately after breeding, moved south to the Bering Sea during freeze-up in December, and wintered in the Bering Sea January-April. Most birds occupied the MIZ in regions averaging 30-60% sea ice concentration, with little seasonal variation. Birds regularly roosted on ice in all seasons averaging 5 h d(-1), primarily at night.

When 2-dimensional (2D; x, y) space-use analyses are used on such groups, their spatial organization is represented as a planar projection of individuals' space-use. Movement on the vertical dimension is ignored and could biased ecological inference made from the spatial structure of the group. We used a digital imaging technique to track movements and feeding behavior of individual animals within a free-range aggregation of juvenile drift-feeding fish (Galaxias anomalus) in 3D and at fine spatiotemporal scales. We estimated spatiotemporal overlap of space-use and feeding territories between group-members using 2D (x, y) and 3D spatial analysis to: (1) describe the spatial structure of the group, (2) identify patterns of resource partitioning, and (3) investigate the relationship between space-use overlap and feeding behavior. We found that overlapping ratios of space-use and feeding territories were over-estimated in 2D, while 3D analysis of space-use provided evidence of spatial partitioning between group-members. We also found that, regardless of the computation used, the overlapping ratios of space-use were positively correlated with overlapping ratios of feeding territories while no effect was found on feeding activity. In conclusion, whilst 3D analysis provided valuable information on the spatial structure of a group, inferences on the ecological function of space-use can also be obtained from 2D analysis.",NA,MAR-APR,2017,101093behecoarw175,NA,NA,NA

We studied GPS bias in the Central Canadian Rockies, a critical area for wildlife conservation, to provide a statistical approach to correct GPS habitat bias for habitat selection studies using GPS collars. To model GPS habitat bias we deployed 11 different collars from 3 brands of GPS collars (Advanced Telemetry Systems LATS], Asanti, MN; LOTEK Engineering Ltd., Newmarket, ON, Canada; and Televilt, Lindesberg, Sweden) in a random-stratified design at 86 sites across habitat and topographic conditions. We modeled the probability of obtaining a successful location, P-FIX, as a function of habitat, topography, and collar brand using mixed-effects logistic regression in an information theoretic approach. For LOTEK collars, we also investigated the effect of 8 and 12 GPS channels on fix rate. The ATS collars had the highest overall fix rates (97.4%), followed by LOTEK 12 channel (94.5%), LOTEK 8 channel (8S.6%), and Televilt (82.3%). Sufficient model selection uncertainty existed to warrant model averaging for logistic regression P-FIX models. Collar brand influenced fix rate in all P-FIX models: fix rates for ATS and LOTEK 12 channel were not statistically different, whereas LOTEK 8 channel receivers had intermediate fix rates, and Televilt had the lowest. Fix rate was reduced in aspen stands, closed coniferous stands, and sites in narrow mountainous valleys but was higher on upper mountain slopes. Slight discrepancies between fix rates from field trials and observed species fix rates (wolf [Canis lupus] and elk [Cervus elaphus]) suggest uncorrected behavioral or movement-induced bias similar to other recent studies. Regardless, the strong habitat-induced bias in GPS fibs rates confirms that in our study area habitat effects are critical, especially for poorer performance brands. Based on previous studies of effects of the amount of bias on inferences, our results suggest correction for GPS bias should be mandatory for Televilt collars in the Canadian Rockies, optional for LOTEK (dependent on the no. of channels), and unnecessary for ATS. Thus, our GPS bias model will be useful to researchers using GPS collars on a variety of species throughout the Rocky Mountain cordillera.",WILDLIFE SOC,AUG,2007,1021932006238,"Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada./Alberta Community Dev, Canmore, AB T1W 1P1, Canada./Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada.","Hebblewhite, M (reprint author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",NA

Evidence exists for deteriorating conditions during the breeding season, but little is known about the situation during the rest of the annual cycle. Here we use two approaches to test if the Dutch breeding population of Skylarks consists of resident and/or migratory individuals. First, we present an analysis of ring recoveries from the Dutch Ringing Centre ""Vogeltrekstation"". Out of 25 recoveries, 12 Skylarks were resident in winter, 10 migrated and three were classified as probable migrants. Resident birds were accompanied during winter by birds from northern and eastern Europe. Very limited natal and breeding dispersal recorded in the same dataset suggests that our results were not influenced by long dispersal distances. Next, we compared these results to a local radio-telemetry study in the northern Netherlands. During two different years we equipped a total of 27 Skylarks from a breeding population with radio-transmitters and followed them during the subsequent winter. Four birds were found to winter locally. Out of 23 individuals that we did not find in winter, 14 returned in the following breeding season to the study area, all with a working transmitter, suggesting that they wintered outside our study area. Two ring recoveries of birds from the same study population indeed showed migration to south-west Europe. Based on these two lines of evidence, we conclude local coexistence of a resident and a migrant strategy in Dutch Skylarks. The findings of our study are important for the planning of conservation efforts, as we can only protect this rapidly declining species when we know their behaviour and whereabouts throughout the entire annual cycle.",NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,FAL,2010,1052530780980202,"[Hegemann, Arne; de Graaf, Merlijn; Oostebrink, Lotte L.; Tieleman, B.

POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE; INFRASOUND; CALL; FRAGMENTATION",NA,"Context. Traffic noise is believed to cause road avoidance and other barrier effects in a variety of wildlife species, and to force changes to call pitch or loudness in others; however, this has never been tested in the absence of other road impacts. Noise impacts on species that do not frequently vocalise are also poorly understood. We investigated traffic-noise impacts on the following three rainforest mammals that do not often vocalise: Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, Uromys caudimaculatus and Perameles nasuta. These species have previously been observed to exhibit varying levels of road avoidance.
Aims. To determine whether traffic noise affects movement and behaviour of medium-sized, ground-dwelling rainforest mammals in the absence of other road-associated variables and potential impacts. We hypothesised that noise impacts would be greatest for species previously shown to avoid roads. Noise impacts on these less vocal species compared with more vocal species is also discussed.
Methods. In north-eastern Queensland, Australia, mammals captured at least 500m from any road were tracked after fitting with spool-and-line equipment. On noisy nights, traffic noise at levels similar to a busy highway was played continuously throughout the night from a line of 12 speakers mounted on trees. Speakers were silent on quiet nights.
Key results. Traffic noise caused no increase in avoidance of the speaker line and was not a barrier to movements across the line. Overall, movement paths on noisy nights appeared similar in pattern (tortuosity) to those of quiet nights. At a finer scale, movements of H. moschatus and P. nasuta became more tortuous later in the track, suggesting a return to normal foraging behaviour and possible habituation to the noise.
Conclusions. These three species with varying levels of previously recorded road avoidance, did not respond negatively to traffic noise. There was, however, a suggestion of habituation by H. moschatus and P. nasuta in response to the noise.
Implications. The demonstrated lack of response to traffic noise in these less vocal species means that traffic noise is unlikely to cause road avoidance or barrier effects. Instead, lack of response and possible habituation to traffic noise may increase vulnerability to road mortality.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2012,101071WR11010,"[Byrnes, Peter; Goosem, Miriam; Turton, Stephen M.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia./[Byrnes, Peter; Goosem, Miriam; Turton, Stephen M.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.","Byrnes, P (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, POB 6811, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",NA

Thus, quantitative evaluations are necessary to assess whether their habitats are protected by these areas. In this study, the representativeness of government-established MPAs and identified priority areas for conservation (PACs) relative to the Brazilian wintering habitat of humpback whales was assessed using satellite telemetry data (n = 74 individuals). Argos-derived location data were filtered and modeled using a switching state space model (SSSM) and overlaid on shapefiles for MPAs and PACs. Humpback whales occurred in only 18.31% of the 71 MPAs observed within the species range. A lower frequency of locations was recorder inside rather than outside these areas. MPAs of Integral Protection used by humpback whales correspond to only 0.64% of the species wintering habitat. In contrast, a total of 40% of the 55 PACs observed within the same area was occupied by the whales, with a higher frequency of locations documented inside the PACs. Our results suggest that PACs encompass the species habitat in a more representative manner than MPAs. Because the former do not provide legal protection, they do not effectively contribute to the species conservation. We suggest PACs used by the species, especially Abrolhos Bank PAC, can be used as basis to refine conservation efforts of humpback whales in their breeding grounds in light of increased anthropogenic stressors. We also demonstrate that animal movement data obtained from satellite telemetry studies are useful for assessing the representativeness of MPAs and to improve management of whales.

We monitored 29 LGDs with GPS (Global Positioning System) collars in order to investigate their space use and association with livestock. UDOI (Utilization Distribution Overlap Index) and the VI (Volume of Intersection) Index for 50% and 95% kernel isopleths were calculated to quantify the overlap and the similarity in the use of space for the core area and for the whole movement range of sheep and dogs. Linear mixed models were implemented to evaluate how dog-sheep distance was influenced by environmental (land use, percentage of trees and shrubs in the pasture, size of pasture), dog-related (sex, age), and farming-related variables (number of livestock guarding dogs associated with the flock, herd size). Finally, we tested the usefulness of GPS pet collars in managing LGDs. LGDs spent the majority of their time close to livestock, sharing the same areas but using the space in a different way. Dog-sheep distance was mostly influenced by the environmental variable land use, and the age of the dog. In fact, dogs and sheep tended to separate more in pastures with a high percentage of trees and shrubs, and less in pastures close to inhabited areas. Moreover, older dogs were more associated to the flock compared to younger individuals. GPS pet collars can be an important tool in managing LGDs, as farmers are able to check the position of their dogs and their flock at any time. This can allow producers to improve their management of LGDs, and to limit conflicts with neighbors and accidents. In this study, we demonstrated that the monitored LGDs did not leave the flock unattended when left unsupervised, although further insights into how they behave would support a full evaluation.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,JAN,2018,101016japplanim201710002,"[Zingaro, Margherita; Boitani, Luigi] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartitnento Biol & Biotecnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy./[Salvatori, Valeria; Vielmi, Luisa] Ist Ecol Applicata, Via B Eustachio 10, I-00161 Rome, Italy.","Zingaro, M (reprint author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartitnento Biol & Biotecnol Charles Darwin, Viale Univ 32, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",NA

The digital divide is targeted by geolocated Twitter data. Based on a sample of eight cities across the globe, we spatially test whether areas of the urban poor are more likely to be digital cold spots. Over the course of time, we analyze whether temporal signatures in poor urban areas differ from formal environments. We find that the economic divide influences digital participation in public life. Less residents of morphological slums are found to be digitally oriented (""are digitally left behind"") as compared to residents of formal settlements.

We discuss the issue of spatiotemporal scale, which is rarely considered in modelling studies, as well as highlighting the need to consider more closely the dynamical nature of home ranges.

They are expected to have evolved mechanisms that keep them in their specific habitation. Since little is known about the recruitment or habitat selection of HV organisms such as brachyurans, we examined the properties of several hydrothermal vent-associated cues on the behavior of the hydrothermal vent (HV) crab Xenograpsus testudinatus in the laboratory that were contrasted by the offering of non-vent cues. This crab species is endemic and dominates the vent fauna of Turtle Island off the NE coast of Taiwan. HV crabs were separately and in combination offered the following vent-specific cues: (1) sulfuric sediment, (3) airbubbling, (4) elevated temperature, (5) dead settled zooplankton, (7) other crabs, and (8) shade. The non-vent-specific cues were: (2) quarz sediment, (6) dead fish, (8) light. These cues were provided on either side of a two-choice chamber. The movement of individual crabs was monitored: as initial and final choices, and as the proportion of time the crabs spent in each compartment (resident time). Cues were offered alone and no such cue as a control in the same set-up. Sulfuric sediments and dead fish were significantly more attractive to females, and other crabs irrespective of gender were significantly more attractive to males. When compared to expected distributions, crabs, irrespective of gender, significantly avoided light and tended to select other crabs, air-bubbling, sulfuric sediment, elevated temperature, dead fish, dead zooplankton, and quarz sediments in the order of decreasing importance. Data do not support the hypothesis that dead settled zooplankton was particularly attractive nor that the other gender was selected. A combination of several vent-associated cues (sulfuric sediment, elevated temperature, air-bubbling) facilitated the strongest attraction to the crabs as reflected by all response variables. The 'first choice' responses were always consistent with the side of the choice compartment in which they spent the longest amount of time (resident time), but not with the 'final choice' of crabs, suggesting that the 'resident time' in addition to their 'first choice' is more reliable than just the 'final choice'. The present results provide the first indication that several vent-associated habitat cues function as attractors for HV crabs. Habitat choice is also reflected by crab larval distribution in the field which tend to stay near the bottom not to be carried away from their specific habitat.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SEP 7,2017,101371journalpone0182649,"[Dahms, Hans-Uwe] Kaohsiung Med Univ, Dept Biomed Sci & Environm Biol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan./[Dahms, Hans-Uwe] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Biotechnol & Resources, Kaohsiung, Taiwan./[Tseng, Li-Chun; Hwang, Jiang-Shiou] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung, Taiwan.","Hwang, JS (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Keelung, Taiwan.",10_1371_journal_pone_0182649

Fish behaviour experiments using Data Storage Tags (DSTs) have been useful to define the natural movement of individuals. In Icelandic waters, such experiments have indicated the presence of two distinct behaviour types of the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, related to vertical migrations and habitat choice in feeding migrations. Some individuals have been shown to stay most of the time in shallow waters characterised by the seasonal trend in temperature for the shelf waters, while other migrate to deeper and colder waters where most of them forage in temperature fronts characterized by highly variable temperatures. The analysis of the pantophysin locus (Pan I) of the same individuals revealed that individuals carrying the Pan I-AA genotype are likely to display a shallow water feeding migrations while individuals carrying the Pan I-BB genotype preferred deeper waters and forage near thermal fronts. The heterozygote exhibited both type of behaviours. This study therefore suggests that further research need to be done on the pantophysin locus and its potential effects on cod phenotypes to assess the potential relationship between this locus and the behavioural types described.",SPRINGER,JAN,2008,101007s105190079175y,"[Pampoulie, Christophe; Jakobsdottir, Klara B.; Thorsteinsson, Vilhjalmur] Marine Res Inst, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland./[Marteinsdottir, Gudrun] Univ Iceland, Dept Biol, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.","Pampoulie, C (reprint author), Marine Res Inst, Skulagata 4, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",10_1007_s10519_007_9175_y

In aquatic animals, circadian activity is often synchronised with diel changes in the depths individuals occupy and may be related to predator-prey interactions, where the circadian rhythm is determined by ambient light levels, or have a thermoregulatory purpose, where the circadian rhythm is governed by temperature. Here, these two hypotheses are examined using animal-attached accelerometers in juvenile freshwater sawfish occupying a riverine environment displaying seasonal changes in thermal stratification. Across seasons, diel patterns of depth use (shallow at night and deep in the day) tended to occur only in the late dry seasons when the water was stratified, whereas individuals were primarily shallow in the early dry season which featured no thermal stratification. Activity was elevated during crepuscular and nocturnal periods compared to daytime, regardless of the thermal environment. Our observation of resting at cooler depths is consistent with behavioural thermoregulation to reduce energy expenditure, whereas activity appears linked to ambient light levels and predatorprey interactions. This suggests that circadian rhythms in activity and vertical migrations are decoupled in this species and respond to independent environmental drivers.",NA,FEB,2017,101007s1075001629576,NA,NA,10_1007_s10750_016_2957_6

Avian","Background: The migratory patterns of animals are changing in response to global environmental change with many species forming resident populations in areas where they were once migratory. The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) was wholly migratory in Europe but recently guaranteed, year-round food from landfill sites has facilitated the establishment of resident populations in Iberia. In this study 17 resident white storks were fitted with GPS/GSM data loggers (including accelerometer) and tracked for 9.1 +/- 3.7 months to quantify the extent and consistency of landfill attendance by individuals during the non-breeding and breeding seasons and to assess the influence of landfill use on daily distances travelled, percentage of GPS fixes spent foraging and non-landfill foraging ranges.
Results: Resident white storks used landfill more during non-breeding (20.1 % +/- 2.3 of foraging GPS fixes) than during breeding (14.9 % +/- 2.2). Landfill attendance declined with increasing distance between nest and landfill in both seasons. During non-breeding a large percentage of GPS fixes occurred on the nest throughout the day (27 % +/- 3.0 of fixes) in the majority of tagged storks. This study provides first confirmation of year-round nest use by resident white storks. The percentage of GPS fixes on the nest was not influenced by the distance between nest and the landfill site. Storks travelled up to 48.2 km to visit landfills during non-breeding and a maximum of 28.1 km during breeding, notably further than previous estimates. Storks nesting close to landfill sites used landfill more and had smaller foraging ranges in non-landfill habitat indicating higher reliance on landfill. The majority of non-landfill foraging occurred around the nest and long distance trips were made specifically to visit landfill.
Conclusions: The continuous availability of food resources on landfill has facilitated year-round nest use in white storks and is influencing their home ranges and movement behaviour. White storks rely on landfill sites for foraging especially during the non-breeding season when other food resources are scarcer and this artificial food supplementation probably facilitated the establishment of resident populations. The closure of landfills, as required by EU Landfill Directives, will likely cause dramatic impacts on white stork populations.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,MAR 15,2016,101186s4046201600700,"[Gilbert, Nathalie I.; Correia, Ricardo A.; Pacheco, Carlos; Catry, Ines; Franco, Aldina M.

Population densities of both species in a 2178-ha fragment of semideciduous Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil were similar to estimates from another regional fragment with 16 times the area. The population of 150 (+/-52) white-lipped peccaries was divided among 3-4 subherds. We observed a high frequency of switching of individuals among subherds and documented periodic subherd fusion. Seven to 22 collared peccary herds (mean herd size, 9) persisted in the main forest fragment. Average home range size for the white-lipped peccaries was 1871 ha (90% HM). This was similar to the few reliable estimates available from continuous tropical forests. Despite supposed area restrictions, white-lipped peccaries maintained distinct seasonal ranges with a minimum of overlap. Within seasons, subherds overlapped spatially, but were separated temporally. Average home range sizes of two radio-tracked collared peccary herds were 305 and 123 ha. Home range boundaries and seasonal ranges of collared peccary herds shifted minimally, and herd subgrouping was short-lived. Spatial overlap between the two peccary species varied seasonally with white-lipped herd movements.

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95% fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m(2) and 3 000m(2), which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result in a 'spill over' effect of adult fish into fishing areas.",NATL INQUIRY SERVICES CENTRE PTY LTD,AUG,2007,102989AJMS200729210193,"Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa./Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.","Kerwath, SE (reprint author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",NA

Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the optimal type of random walk will vary based on the distribution of resources such as prey. Once resources are located, the animal may utilize a movement strategy that allows it to remain within a small area and maximize resource acquisition (area-restricted searching, ARS). Detecting the location of ARS zones is important, as it identifies profitable habitat to the animal, although such analysis is rarely conducted with fishes. We utilized correlated random walk (CRW), fractal, and first passage time (FPT) analysis to quantify the response of planktivorous manta rays Manta alfredi to spatial scale and identify locations of ARS within lagoons at Palmyra Atoll. Mantas used CRWs at small spatial scales to move between prey patches, but not at larger scales as they performed home-ranging behavior. One domain was located with straighter movements at scales <330 m, and more tortuous movements at scales >330 m. ARS was located adjacent to ledges with high abundance of plankton, or within channels. Fractal and FPT analyses suggest that mantas used patches that were 5 to 49% of the scale of their activity space over short time periods (days).

Among other factors, the scale and rate of such bioturbations will be influenced by the population density, as well as by the pattern and speed of movement of members of such a faunal group. Any attempt to obtain an estimate of the effects of the activity of such groups on the sediment is accompanied by a number of assumptions about their individual mode of movement. We examined the degree to which these estimates depend on the assumed mode of motion. Speed and behaviour data were recovered from a free-vehicle camera for the elasipodid holothurian Oneirophanta mutabilis a dominant component of the mobile invertebrate megafauna on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP), northeast Atlantic. Using these data, we developed a number of simulations to determine the time taken by the PAP population of O. mutabilis to cover 50% of the sediment area (t(50%)) by differing ranging strategies. At a hypothetical population density of 27.78 indiv. x 10(-3) m(-2) using a systematic search, t(50%) is 12 days whereas for a random ranging strategy, t(50%) is 17 years. A simulation incorporating observed distributions of speed and angles of turn, hence approximating the actual behaviour of the holothurian, issued a t(50%) of 9.6 years. The behaviour of the animal is shown to have a profound effect on areal coverage times and consequent rates of bioturbation. Simply multiplying mean speed by swath width is shown to be too simplistic an approach.

The Boma-Jonglei ecosystem in South Sudan, one of the world's poorest and most conflicted countries, contains some of the largest, longest, and least studied ungulate migrations. A rapidly increasing human population, ongoing armed conflict, and looming oil development, however, threatens the migration of 800,000 white-eared kob (Kobus kob leucotis) and 160,000 tiang (Damaliscus lunatus tiang) in this system. To document these migrations and identify potential conflicts, we examined the movements of ungulates in the Boma-Jonglei ecosystem using data from 14 collared individuals (12 kob, 2 tiang). We identified two separate dry season ranges of kob; from each, kob initiated migration with the onset of the rainy season, and migrated to a shared rainy season range also shared by the tiang. The maximum straight-line distance between telemetry locations of kob (399 km) and tiang (298 km) on their dry and rainy season ranges indicated these migrations were among the longest in Africa. The kob range was 68,805 km(2), 29% of which was within national parks and 72% within leased oil concessions (54-83% of parks overlap with potential oil concessions). The range of the tiang (35,992 km(2)) occurred almost entirely (> 99%) within land leased to oil companies. Because disruption or elimination of these migrations will inevitably lead to significant population reductions, maintenance of the migration routes we identified through additional protection measures are essential to conserve one of the largest ungulate aggregations in the world.",SPRINGER,FEB,2018,101007s1053101714407,"[Morjan, Malik D.; Rayl, Nathaniel D.; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA./[Morjan, Malik D.] Minist Wildlife Conservat & Tourism, Juba, South Sudan./[Elkan, Paul W.; Deutsch, James C.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, 2300 Southern Blvd, Bronx, NY 10460 USA./[Deutsch, James C.] Vulcan Inc, 505 Fifth Ave S,Suite 900, Seattle, WA 98104 USA./[Henke, M.

To retrieve the current velocity, the following feature is utilized: the total power reaches a maximum when a suitable current is used in the beamforming calculation. Because the new algorithm is based on individual pixel points, as opposed to the full image in the conventional method, the coordinate transformation procedure can be avoided. Because of the filter capacity in beamforming, moving vessels and shadowing have little effect on the estimate results, and the empirical modulation transfer function is not required to amend the wave spectrum.

We fitted eight adult sifakas from seven different groups living in Kirindy forest with an accelerometer/data logger device and recorded their activity in 5-min bins for a total of 12 months. We characterise P. verreauxi as a strictly diurnal species with a pronounced bimodal activity pattern that briefly changed to a more unimodal pattern during their annual mating season (January to March). We documented significant annual variation in total daily activity, activity time, and activity level, as well as in most parameters characterising their bimodal activity pattern. Despite a significant positive correlation of the animals' activity time with day length, pronounced annual variation in the phase position of onset and end of activity in relation to sunrise and sunset times could also be discerned. Minor enhancing effects of moonlight on nocturnal activity were only found for the first 3 h of the inactivity period. Bimodality of the activity pattern and the additional reduction of activity time during the cold and dry winter months associated with reduced food availability can be interpreted as flexible behavioural adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. We therefore propose that energetic and thermoregulatory benefits are important factors shaping these primates' activity pattern.",SPRINGER,DEC,2004,101007s002650040845y,"Univ Tubingen, Zool Inst Tierphysiol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany./Deutsch Primatenzentrum GmbH, Abt Soziobiol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.","Erkert, HG (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Zool Inst Tierphysiol, Auf Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",10_1007_s00265_004_0845_y

Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) hatchlings were tagged with miniature acoustic transmitters and their movements tracked within an underwater array of 36 acoustic receivers placed in the near shore zone. A total of 40 hatchlings were tracked, 20 of which were subjected to artificial light during their transit of the array. At the same time, we measured current speed and direction, which were highly variable within and between experimental nights and treatments. Artificial lighting affected hatchling behaviour, with 88% of individual trajectories oriented towards the light and spending, on average, 23% more time in the 2.25 ha tracking array (19.5 +/- 5 min) than under ambient light conditions (15.8 +/-\5 min). Current speed had little to no effect on the bearing (angular direction) of the hatchling tracks when artificial light was present, but under ambient conditions it influenced the bearing of the tracks when current direction was offshore and above speeds of approximately 32.5 cm s(-1). This is the first experimental evidence that wild turtle hatchlings are attracted to artificial light after entering the ocean, a behaviour that is likely to subject them to greater risk of predation. The experimental protocol described in this study can be used to assess the effect of anthropogenic ( light pollution, noise, etc.) and natural ( wave action, current, wind, moonlight) influences on the in-water movements of sea turtle hatchlings during the early phase of dispersal.",ROYAL SOC,MAY,2016,101098rsos160142,"[Thums, Michele; Fisher, Rebecca; Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst M096, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[Thums, Michele; Pattiaratchi, Charitha B.; Hetzel, Yasha; Fisher, Rebecca; Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[Thums, Michele; Pendoley, Kellie L.; Hetzel, Yasha; Fisher, Rebecca; Meekan, Mark G.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[Reisser, Julia; Pattiaratchi, Charitha B.; Hetzel, Yasha] Univ Western Australia, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn M015, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[Whiting, Scott D.] Dept Pk & Wildlife, Marine Sci Program, 17 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia./[Reisser, Julia] Torenhove, Ocean Cleanup Fdn, Martinus Nijhofflaan 2,18th Floor, NL-2624 ES Delft, Netherlands./[Pendoley, Kellie L.] Pendoley Environm Pty Ltd, 2-1 Aldous Pl, Booragoon, WA 6154, Australia./[Proietti, Maira] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Ave Italia Km 08, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.","Thums, M (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst M096, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Thums, M (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Thums, M (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",NA

We investigated the effect of light pollution on nocturnal vigilance in peahens (Pavo cristatus). Captive peahens were exposed to either artificial lighting or natural lighting at night. We employed a novel method to record their vigilance behavior by attaching accelerometers to their heads and continuously monitoring their large head movements. We found that light pollution significantly increases nocturnal vigilance in peahens. Furthermore, the birds faced a trade-off between vigilance and sleep at night: peahens that were more vigilant spent less time sleeping. Given the choice, peahens preferred to roost away from high levels of artificial lighting but showed no preference for roosting without artificial lighting or with low levels of artificial lighting. Our study demonstrates that light pollution can have a substantial impact on animal behavior that can potentially result in fitness consequences.",PEERJ INC,AUG 13,2015,107717peerj1174,"[Yorzinski, Jessica L.; Wolf, Jamie A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA./[Yorzinski, Jessica L.; Byerley, Sydney D.; Coy, Jeanee R.; Aziz, Aisyah; Gnerlich, Amanda C.] Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA./[Chisholm, Sarah] UCL, Ctr Computat Stat & Machine Learning, London, England.","Yorzinski, JL (reprint author), Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",10_7717_peerj_1174

The work has progressed from the early stages, in which we used randomly positioned points, to current investigations of animats (computer-simulated animals), which show low levels of learning via artificial neural networks. We have determined that 1) pens of equal floor area but of different shape result in different spatial and movement patterns for randomly positioned and moving animats; 2) when group size increases under constant density, freedom of movement approaches an asymptote at approximately six animats; 3) matching the number of animats with the number of corners results in optimal freedom of movement for small groups of animats; and 4) perimeter positioning occurs in groups of animats that maximize their distance to first- and second-nearest neighbors. Recently, we developed animats that move, compete for social dominance, and are motivated to obtain resources (food, resting sites, etc.). We are currently developing an animat that learns its behavior fi om the spatial and movement data collected on live pigs. The animat model is then used to pretest pen designs, followed by new pig spatial data fed into the animat model, resulting in a new pen design to be tested, and the steps are repeated. We believe that methodologies from artificial-life and artificial intelligence can contribute to the understanding of basic animal behavior principles, as well as to the solving of problems in production agriculture in areas such as animal housing design.",AMER SOC ANIMAL SCIENCE,OCT,1998,nodoi2853464163,"Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA./Prairie Swine Ctr, Saskatoon, SK S7H 5N9, Canada.","Stricklin, WR (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",NA

Colour can be used to identify the suitability of a food source or improve the efficiency of food detection, and can even be linked to mate choice. Food colour preferences are known to exist, but whether these preferences are heritable and how these preferences evolve is unknown. Using the freshwater fish Poecilia reticulata, we artificially selected for chase behaviour towards two different-coloured moving stimuli: red and blue spots. A response to selection was only seen for chase behaviours towards the red, with realized heritabilities ranging from 0.25 to 0.30. Despite intense selection, no significant chase response was recorded for the blue-selected lines. This lack of response may be due to the motion-detection mechanism in the guppy visual system and may have novel implications for the evolvability of responses to colour-related signals. The behavioural response to several colours after five generations of selection suggests that the colour opponency system of the fish may regulate the response to selection.",ROYAL SOC,APR 7,2015,101098rspb20143108,"[Cole, Gemma L.; Endler, John A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia.","Cole, GL (reprint author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Waurn Ponds, Vic 3216, Australia.",4375879

Bull, C. Michael",NA,NA,NA,"Pastoralism is a major agricultural activity in drier environments, and can directly and indirectly impact native species in those areas. We investigated how the supply of an artificial watering point to support grazing livestock affected movement and activity patterns of the Australian sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) during a drought year. We observed 23 adult lizards; six had access to a dam, whereas 17 lizards did not. Lizards with access to the dam had larger home ranges, were substantially active on more days (days with >100 steps), and moved more steps per day compared to lizards that did not have access to the dam, both during the early and late period of our observation. Furthermore, while the two groups of lizards had similar body condition early in the season, they differed later in the season. Lizards with dam access retained, whereas lizards without access lost body condition. Local heterogeneity in access to an artificial water resource resulted in spatially dependent behavioural variation among sleepy lizard individuals. This suggests that sleepy lizards have flexible responses to changing climatic conditions, depending on the availability of water. Furthermore, while reducing activity appears a suitable short term strategy, if harsh conditions persist, then access to dams could be of substantial benefit and could support sustained lizard activity and movement and allow maintenance of body condition. Hence, artificial watering points, such as the dams constructed by pastoralists, may provide local higher quality refugia for sleepy lizards and other species during drought conditions.",NA,JAN 22,2016,101371journalpone0147433,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0147433

In some cases, invaders only become established in habitats where dominant native species have been displaced as a result of human actions or where humans inadvertently provide essential resources such as food, water or shelter. We investigated if dams that provide water for livestock have facilitated the cane toad's (Rhinella marina) invasion of a hot semi-arid landscape by providing toads with a resource subsidy and hence refuge from extreme heat and aridity. To determine the relationship between the presence of surface water and habitat occupancy by toads, we surveyed natural and artificial water features for cane toads during the annual dry season. We used radiotracking and acoustic tags to determine whether movement patterns and shelter use of cane toads were focussed around dams. To determine whether dams provide toads with refuge from extreme heat and aridity, we deployed plaster models with internal thermometers to estimate ambient temperatures and toad desiccation rates in shelter sites. To determine whether dams alleviate the stress experienced by toads, we measured plasma corticosterone levels of toads that sheltered in and away from dams. Toads were present in sites with standing water and absent from waterless sites. Most radiotracked toads sheltered within 1m of water. Toad movements were focussed around water. Toads tracked with passive acoustic telemetry over a 6-month dry season were highly resident at dams. Plaster models placed in toad shelter sites away from the water lost 27% more mass and experienced higher temperatures than models placed near the water's edge. Toads that sheltered in terrestrial shelters exhibited higher plasma corticosterone levels compared to toads that sheltered near dams. Dams provide toads with refuge habitats where they are less at risk from overheating and dehydration. Synthesis and applications.

Understanding how elephants use such landscapes may help facilitate their movements and reduce conflict incidence. We studied elephants' use of fragmented habitats and ranging patterns of focal herds in a landscape of rainforest fragments embedded in tea, coffee, and Eucalyptus plantations in the Anamalai Hills. Elephant herds entering this landscape were tracked daily between April 2002 and March 2006, resulting in 985 GPS locations of herds obtained across six major habitats. Natural vegetation in rainforest fragments and riparian habitats, despite low coverage in the landscape, was preferred by elephants during the day. At night, elephants preferred riparian vegetation, avoided other habitats such as swamps and settlements, while the remaining habitats were used proportional to availability. Use of rainforest fragments and riparian vegetation increased over three years of study with a corresponding decline in the use of tea monoculture. Among plantation habitats, coffee, and Eucalyptus were used significantly more during wet and dry seasons, respectively. The concentration of elephants along a major riparian system in the center of the landscape emphasized the role of water and food availability in habitat use during the dry season. Protection of rainforest fragments, secondary vegetation along rivers, and regulated and sequential felling (instead of clear-felling) of Eucalyptus along elephant movement routes will help retain forage, cover, and passage routes of elephant herds and may reduce direct human-elephant encounters in such fragmented landscapes.",TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE,NA,2010,1.01177194008291E+023,"[Kumar, M.

The semi-arid Karoo, South Africa, a large ecosystem with a high degree of endemism, is targeted for fracking. We investigated how adult leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis) use their environment by determining individual and seasonal variation in home range and effects of weather factors on these pre-fracking. Data were obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters placed on leopard tortoises (n = 11) on private livestock farms near Beaufort West, South Africa for a year. Kernel density estimation (KDE) was used to estimate home range. Individuals had a mean (+/- SE) home range of 121.86 +/- 28.12 ha, (range 40.53-258.52 ha) with a core area of 76.55 +/- 17.33 ha (range 21.22-83.89 ha). No difference was found between annual male and female home ranges. Two telemetered individuals were excluded from analysis because they exhibited apparent nomadic behaviour. Several individuals did not visit permanent water sources, possibly suggesting that dietary water intake was sufficient. Generalised Linear Mixed Models were used to explain monthly home range estimates (95% KDEhref) in regards to biologically significant predictor variables. A single top model (Delta AIC(c) < 2) was produced, indicating importance of individual variability (sex, body mass) and weather (temperature, rainfall) variables.

Heterogeneity arises from variation in abiotic and biotic conditions, including changes in substratum, geochemistry, fluid flow, biological communities and ecological interactions. The seepage of heavy hydrocarbons to the seafloor is less well studied than most other cold seep systems and may lead to the formation of asphalt mounds. These have been described from several regions, particularly the Gulf of Mexico. Here, we describe the structure, potential formation and biology of a large asphalt mound province in Block 31SE Angola. A total of 2254 distinct mound features was identified by side-scan sonar, covering a total area of 3.7 km(2) of seafloor. The asphalt mounds took a number of forms from small (<0.5 m diameter; 13% observations) mounds to large extensive (<50 m diameter) structures. Some of the observed mounds were associated with authigenic carbonate and active seepage (living chemosynthetic fauna present in addition to the asphalt). The asphalt mounds are seabed accumulations of heavy hydrocarbons formed from subsurface migration and fractionation of reservoir hydrocarbons primarily through a network of faults. In Angola these processes are controlled by subsurface movement of salt structures. The asphalt mounds were typically densely covered with epifauna (74.5% of mounds imaged had visible epifauna) although individual mounds varied considerably in epifaunal coverage. Of the 49 non-chemosynthetic megafaunal taxa observed, 19 taxa were only found on hard substrata (including asphalt mounds), 2 fish species inhabited the asphalt mounds preferentially and 27 taxa were apparently normal soft-sediment fauna. Antipatharians (3.6 +/- 2.3% s.e.) and poriferans (2.6 +/- 1.9% s.e.) accounted for the highest mean percentage of the observed cover, with actinarians (0.9 +/- 0.4% s.e.) and alcyonaceans (0.4 +/- 02% s.e.) covering smaller proportions of the area. Asphalt mounds represent a common and important habitat on several margin systems globally and should be recognised in future environmental assessment and management of these areas.

This study introduces an integrated method based on geographical information systems (GIS) and an emotion-tracking technique to quantify the relationship between people's emotional responses and urban space. This method can evaluate the degree to which people's emotional responses are influenced by multiple urban characteristics such as building shapes and textures, isovist parameters, visual entropy, and visual fractals. The results indicate that urban spaces may influence people's emotional responses through both spatial sequence arrangements and shifting scenario sequences. Emotional data were collected with body sensors and GPS devices. Spatial clustering was detected to target effective sampling locations; then, isovists were generated to extract building textures.

Despite the increased interest in biodiversity assessment in urban environments, the ecological relevance of habitat connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes remains largely unknown. The first step to understanding the role of habitat connectivity in urban ecology is the challenging task of assessing connectivity in the complex patchwork of contrasting habitats that is found in cities.
We developed a data-based framework, minimizing the use of subjective assumptions, to assess habitat connectivity that consists of the following sequential steps: (1) identification of habitat preference based on empirical habitat-use data; (2) derivation of habitat resistance surfaces evaluating various transformation functions; (3) modeling of different connectivity maps with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape), a method considering all possible pathways across the landscape simultaneously; and (4) identification of the best connectivity map with information-theoretic model selection. We applied this analytical framework to assess habitat connectivity for the European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, a model species for ground-dwelling animals, in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, using GPS track points from 40 individuals.
The best model revealed spatially explicit connectivity ""pinch points,"" as well as multiple habitat connections. Cross-validation indicated the general validity of the selected connectivity model. The results show that both habitat connectivity and habitat quality affect the movement of urban hedgehogs (relative importance of the two variables was 19.2% and 80.8%, respectively), and are thus both relevant for predicting urban animal movements.
Our study demonstrates that even in the complex habitat patchwork of cities, habitat connectivity plays a major role for ground-dwelling animal moverrient. Data-based habitat connectivity maps can thus serve as an important tool for city planners to identify habitat corridors and plan appropriate management and conservation measures for urban animals. The analytical framework we describe to model such connectivity maps is generally applicable to different types of habitat-use data and can be adapted to the movement scale of the focal species. It also allows evaluation of the impact of future landscape changes or management scenarios on habitat connectivity in urban landscapes.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,OCT,2014,nodoi6753544127,"[Braaker, S.; Moretti, M.; Boesch, R.; Obrist, M.

Understanding factors controlling the distribution of free-ranging livestock requires the ability to assess when and where they are foraging. For four years (2008-2011), we periodically collected GPS and activity sensor data together with direct observations of collared cattle grazing semiarid rangeland in eastern Colorado. From these data, we developed classification tree models that allowed us to discriminate between grazing and non-grazing activities. We evaluated: (1) which activity sensor measurements from the GPS collars were most valuable in predicting cattle foraging behavior, (2) the accuracy of binary (grazing, non-grazing) activity models vs. models with multiple activity categories (grazing, resting, traveling, mixed), and (3) the accuracy of models that are robust across years vs. models specific to a given year. A binary classification tree correctly removed 86.5% of the non-grazing locations, while correctly retaining 87.8% of the locations where the animal was grazing, for an overall misclassification rate of 12.9%. A classification tree that separated activity into four different categories yielded a greater misclassification rate of 16.0%. Distance travelled in a 5 minute interval and the proportion of the interval with the sensor indicating a head down position were the two most important variables predicting grazing activity. Fitting annual models of cattle foraging activity did not improve model accuracy compared to a single model based on all four years combined. This suggests that increased sample size was more valuable than accounting for interannual variation in foraging behavior associated with variation in forage production. Our models differ from previous assessments in semiarid rangeland of Israel and mesic pastures in the United States in terms of the value of different activity sensor measurements for identifying grazing activity, suggesting that the use of GPS collars to classify cattle grazing behavior will require calibrations specific to the environment and vegetation being studied.",MDPI AG,MAR,2013,103390s130303711,"[Augustine, David J.] ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, USDA, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA./[Derner, Justin D.] ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, USDA, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA.","Augustine, DJ (reprint author), ARS, Rangeland Resources Res Unit, USDA, 1701 Ctr Ave, Ft Collins, CO 80525 USA.",3658770

Moose (Alces alces cameloides) and roe deer (Capreolus pygargus bedfordi) populations are in decline in north-eastern China, an area managed for forestry production. We obtained detailed information about these species' use of habitat by following their movement paths in snow and recording behaviours exhibited along their paths. We used fractal analysis, Mann-Whitney U-tests and linear mixed models to analyse the paths and the relationships between tortuousity, habitat, and the expressed behaviours at different spatial scales. This analysis showed a natural break in the fractal dimension of moose movement paths at a scale of similar to 10 m, suggesting that moose exhibited different responses to their microhabitat and behavioural requirements at scales above and below this threshold. However, we detected no differences in the responses of roe deer over a scale range of 3-20 m. Moose paths tended to pass through areas with higher basal areas of tree stems and those with deeper snow. Roe deer showed positive associations between tortuousity and the number of bedding sites and feeding sites, and a negative association between tortuousity and the total basal area of tree stems. There was a positive relationship between the numbers of bedding and defaecating sites, and a negative association between the number of bedding sites and snow depth. For moose, we found positive associations between tortuousity and the number of defaecating sites, the basal areas of both broadleaf stands and mixed conifer and broadleaf stands, and a negative association between tortuousity and the number of feeding sites. We concluded that roe deer foraged in accordance with patch-use theory, whereas moose foraged in accordance with diet-selection theory. We concluded that modi. cations to forestry practices to foster the populations of both species of deer will require forestry operations to be conducted on a much finer scale, and that one species can be promoted over the other by selective fine-scale habitat management.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2009,101071WR08092,"[Jiang, Guangshun; Ma, Jianzhang; Zhang, Minghai] NE Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China./[Stott, Philip] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Roseworthy, SA 5371, Australia.","Ma, JZ (reprint author), NE Forestry Univ, Coll Wildlife Resources, 26 Hexing Rd, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",10_1071_WR08092

A laboratory experiment using adult sea cucumbers showed that P. californicus changed their foraging behaviour based on available amounts of TOM, moving more randomly in high-TOM (similar to 8.0%) areas and more directly in low-TOM (similar to 1.4%) ones. They also moved more rapidly in areas with high TOM than in those with low TOM. As long as animals were exposed to high TOM, they did not abandon random movement. Because of this behaviour, aquaculture tenures may retain a population of cultured individuals, but could also attract wild individuals from the surrounding area.",NA,NA,2016,103354aei00156,NA,NA,10_3354_aei00156

Pech, Roger P.",NA,NA,NA,"In New Zealand, managing the threat of bovine tuberculosis (TB) to livestock includes population reduction of potentially infectious wildlife, primarily the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Population control is often targeted on forested buffer zones adjacent to farmland, in order to limit movements of possums across the buffer and reduce the risk of disease transmission to livestock. To assess the effectiveness of buffers in protecting livestock we analysed GPS telemetry data from possums located in untreated forest adjacent to buffers, and used these data to characterise patterns of movement that could lead to possums reaching farmland during the season when most dispersal occurs. Analyses of movement data showed that the direction of dispersal by sub-adult and adult possums and the extent of long exploratory movements were not biased toward forest buffers, even though these provided vacant habitat as suitable for possums as untreated forest. Instead, dispersal and exploratory movements were uncommon even for sub-adult possums and such events typically lasted < 10 days. Dispersing possums settled predominantly in river valleys. A simulation model was developed for the 3-6-month dispersal season; it demonstrated a probability of <0.001 that an infected possum, originating from a low-density population with low disease prevalence in untreated forest, would move across 3 km of recently controlled forest buffer to reach farmland. Our results indicate short-term reduction in the risk of TB transmission from possums to livestock in New Zealand by the use of depopulated buffer zones, while acknowledging that the threat of disease spread from untreated forest is likely to increase over time as possum population density and, potentially, TB prevalence among those possums, increase in the buffer zone.",NA,DEC 21,2015,101371journalpone0145636,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0145636

The KF algorithm is reported to increase the number and accuracy of estimated positions over the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm, with potential advantages to the application of state-space methods to model animal movement data. We tested the performance of two Bayesian state-space models (SSMs) fitted to satellite tracking data processed with KF algorithm. Tracks from 7 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with ARGOS satellite transmitters equipped with Fastloc GPS loggers were used to calculate the error of locations estimated from SSMs fitted to KF and LS data, by comparing those to ""true"" GPS locations. Data on 6 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were used to investigate consistency in movement parameters, location and behavioural states estimated by switching state-space models (SSSM) fitted to data derived from KF and LS methods. The model fit to KF locations improved the accuracy of seal trips by 27% over the LS model. 82% of locations predicted from the KF model and 73% of locations from the LS model were <5 km from the corresponding interpolated GPS position. Uncertainty in KF model estimates (5.6 +/- 5.6 km) was nearly half that of LS estimates (11.6 +/- 8.4 km). Accuracy of KF and LS modelled locations was sensitive to precision but not to observation frequency or temporal resolution of raw Argos data. On average, 88% of whale locations estimated by KF models fell within the 95% probability ellipse of paired locations from LS models. Precision of KF locations for whales was generally higher. Whales' behavioural mode inferred by KF models matched the classification from LS models in 94% of the cases. State-space models fit to KF data can improve spatial accuracy of location estimates over LS models and produce equally reliable behavioural estimates.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 20,2014,101371journalpone0092277,"[Silva, Monica A.; Prieto, Rui] Univ Azores, Ctr Inst Marine Res IMAR, Horta, Portugal./[Silva, Monica A.; Prieto, Rui] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Horta, Portugal./[Silva, Monica A.; Prieto, Rui] Lab Robot & Syst Engn & Sci LARSyS, Lisbon, Portugal./[Silva, Monica A.; Baumgartner, Mark F.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA./[Jonsen, Ian] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada./[Russell, Deborah J.

The relationship security of each group member can be determined using the level of social anxiety found when that individual is in the proximity of other individuals. I studied social anxiety by measuring the rate of rough self-scratching behaviour (RSS), a self-directed behaviour, in wild chimpanzees in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. The RSS rate drastically differed across individual activities; RSS was rare when the focal individual was foraging or moving, but frequent during resting. The male RSS rate while resting was inversely correlated with dominance rank, particularly when males were with other group members; higher-ranking males performed RSS less often than lower-ranking males. The RSS frequency of males did not vary with the proximity of group members or the association level of the individuals in proximity. In contrast, close proximity of group members increased the female RSS rate. In addition, females performed RSS more frequently when a non-affiliative group member was in their proximity than with an affiliative group member. The relative dominance rank of the individuals in close proximity did not affect the RSS rate in either males or females. Furthermore, infant contact or separation from the mother did not influence the maternal RSS rate. These results suggest that anxiety-inducing situations differ between sexes in this species, and that for female chimpanzees, relationship security is related to association level. The results are discussed in terms of interspecific variation in social dominance style and inter-individual tolerance within primates.",BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,AUG-SEP,2003,1.01163156853903E+023,"Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Cognit & Behav Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.","Kutsukake, N (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Biol Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",NA

Much of the Mississippi Flyway population of this species stages each autumn at this site, en route to the Gulf coast and Mexico. Between 1986-96, weekly or bi-weekly counts were made of gulls flying to their nocturnal roost at the mouth of the Niagara River entering Lake Ontario, to assess the seasonal and temporal patterns of movement. Counts began each year in early October, corresponding to the 'second wave' of gulls. Generally, this second wave of autumn movements began in early October to late November (median 1 November) and continued until late January or mid-February (median 5 February). Model selection based on a repeated measures analysis (Generalized Estimating Equations) demonstrated a quadratic relationship between counts and time of year and a linear relationship with daily count duration. Less evidence existed for the role of mean daily temperature in explaining variation (positive relationship) in counts; more data, or inclusion of different weather variables (e.g., wind, cloud cover), may demonstrate that it is more important than our models suggest. Maximum counts were from early November to late January (median 6 December). Peak daily totals per season varied between 6,300 (1993/94) and 40,000 (1990/91). Migration counts may be useful to help monitor populations of this species, provided that variables affecting seasonality in counts are accounted for and the turn-over rate of individual gulls staging in the area is determined (e.g., through mark-recapture or radio-telemetry studies).",WATERBIRD SOC,JUN,2008,10167515244695200831193ASVICA20CO2,"[Weseloh, D.

Assessing swine thermal comfort by image analysis of postural behaviors,12080,"Xin, H",J ANIM SCI,GROWING-PIGS; TEMPERATURE,behavior; image processing; neural networks; animal welfare,"Postural behavior is an integral response of animals to complex environmental factors. Huddling, nearly contacting one another on the side, and spreading are common postural behaviors of group-housed animals undergoing cold, comfortable, and warm/hot sensations, respectively. These postural patterns have been routinely used by animal caretakers to assess thermal comfort of the animals and to make according adjustment on the environmental settings or management schemes. This manual adjustment approach, however, has the inherent limitations of daily discontinuity and inconsistency between caretakers in interpretation of the animal comfort behavior. The goal of this project was to explore a novel, automated image analysis system that would assess the thermal comfort of swine and make proper environmental adjustments to enhance animal wellbeing and production efficiency. This paper describes the progress and on-going work toward the achievement of our proposed goal. The feasibility of classifying the thermal comfort state of young pigs by neural network (NN) analysis of their postural images was first examined. It included exploration of using certain feature selections of the postural behavioral images as the input to a three-layer NN that was trained to classify the corresponding thermal comfort state as being cold, comfortable, or warm. The image feature selections, a critical step for the classification, examined in this study included Fourier coefficient (FC), moment (M), perimeter and area (P&A), and combination of M and P&A of the processed binary postural images. The result was positive, with the combination of M and P&A as the input feature to the NN yielding the highest correct classification rate. Subsequent work included the development of hardware and computational algorithms that enable automatic image segmentation, motion detection, and the selection of the behavioral images suitable for use in the classification. Work is in progress to quantify the relationships of postural behavior and physiological responses of pigs using thermographs. The results are expected to facilitate objective training of NN, hence improving the accuracy of the postural image-based assessment of the thermal comfort state. Work is also in progress to implement the analysis and assessment algorithms into computer codes for real-time application.",AMER SOC ANIMAL SCIENCE,NA,1999,nodoi4194386547,"Iowa State Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.","Xin, H (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Agr & Biosyst Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",NA

An accurate estimate of the error, and therefore the limitations of the data, is critical when assessing the level of confidence in results. ARGOS provides published 68th percentile error estimates for the three most accurate location classes (LCs), but studies have shown that the errors can be far greater when the devices are attached to free-living animals. Here we use data from a study looking at the habitat use of the spectacled flying-fox in the wet tropics of Queensland to calculate these errors for all LCs in free-living terrestrial mammals, and use these results to assess what level of confidence we would have in habitat use assignment in the study area. The results showed that our calculated 68th percentile errors were larger than the published ARGOS errors for all LCs, and that for all classes the error frequency had a very long tail. Habitat use results showed that the size of the error compared with the scale of the habitat the study was conducted in makes it unlikely that our data can be used to assess habitat use with great confidence. Overall, our results show that while satellite telemetry results are useful for assessing large scale movements of animals, in complex landscapes they may not be accurate enough to be used for finer scale analysis including habitat use assessment.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,MAY,2012,101111j14429993201102276x,"[McKeown, Adam; Westcott, David A.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst Sci, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia.","McKeown, A (reprint author), CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst Sci, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia.",NA

Such encroachments may also lead to selective changes in life history and behaviour. Hydropower construction worldwide has fragmented many previously continuous fish habitats, leading to loss of populations and production. It is therefore important to assess potential impacts on habitats before such developments begin. Here, the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of planned hydropower development on two migratory salmonid fishes - brown trout (Salmo trutta) and European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) - were assessed, combining telemetry with population genetics. Almost 200 fish were radio-tagged and tracked weekly between March and November. Using microsatellite markers, the genetic population structure was assessed and the number of migrants among different river sections identified for both species. Overall, both species displayed extensive within- and between-river movement, with larger home ranges in grayling than in trout. Regular movements between distinct spawning, feeding and wintering areas were common. These vital habitats were often located within areas of planned hydropower development. Both species exhibited significant population genetic structuring within the study area, with waterfalls acting as impassable barriers to upstream gene flow for grayling. The structuring was more developed for trout than for grayling. However, downstream gene flow was common, resulting in a highly admixed trout population below a waterfall. The large-scale movement patterns and extensive connectivity of the system indicate that habitat fragmentation and changes in water flow will adversely affect both species, but most strongly the trout. The reduction in water flow over large and productive stretches of the river might select for less migratory genotypes in both species. The loss of particular genotypes may reduce the biocomplexity of the system and overall population resilience.

Since chronic behavioural modifications can ultimately alter reproductive success and population dynamics, studying the response of different taxa and species to human-induced disturbance in different habitats is paramount. The present study analysed data collected from 10 male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) monitored with GPS collars to assess their response to disturbance caused by helicopter overflights. We compared ibex activity levels in the hours before and after 34 helicopter overflights during the summer of 2013 in Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), a protected area that is essential for the conservation of Alpine ibex. The behaviour of Alpine ibex was affected both during and after helicopter overflights: compared to the average activity levels in the hours before the disturbance event, activity increased during the disturbance and decreased during the hour following the overflights. The reduction in activity persisted over the whole day of the helicopter disturbance and finally went back to normal levels during the following day. There was no evidence of habituation to the disturbance throughout the study period. The prolonged behavioural response to the disturbance suggests that frequent helicopter overflights may ultimately affect the ibex's body conditions, as well as the life-history traits of a population. These findings highlight the importance of considering medium and long-term behavioural responses in assessing disturbance-related effects on wildlife populations.

This can be achieved by the attachment of global positioning system (GPS) data loggers, which, in large species, is best achieved by remote immobilisation. Feral horses (Equus caballus) usually occupy remote areas of Australia; however, a considerable population increase has been observed in a close proximity to metropolitan areas of the Australian east coast, creating increasing conflict with human interests.
Aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of remote chemical immobilisation of feral horses with medetomidine combined with tiletamine-zolazepam to facilitate placement of satellite GPS collars.
Methods Nine feral horses were darted from the ground with 60mg (i.m.) medetomidine and 1500mg (i.m.) tiletamine-zolazepam. The effects of medetomidine were reversed with 50-100mg (i.m. or i.v.) atipamezole 30-40min after induction (IV/IM). Physiological variables monitored during anaesthesia were heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen haemoglobin saturation (S(p)o(2)).
Key results All horses were successfully immobilised with between one and three darts (n=9). The mean ( s.e.m.) dose of medetomidine was 0.150.01mg kg(-1), whereas that of tiletamine-zolazepam was 3.61 +/- 0.16mg kg(-1). Mean time from darting to lateral recumbency was 13.3 +/- 2.7min and mean recumbency time was 54 +/- 13min. Vital signs for all anaesthetised animals remained within the normal range during anaesthesia, with the exception of one animal exhibiting a transient drop in S(p)o(2). There were no deaths.
Key conclusions The combination of medetomidine and tiletamine-zolazepam provided adequate anaesthesia in feral horses in the field for application of GPS collars.
Implications Although a limited number of horses was immobilised, the present study shows that the combination of medetomidine and tiletamine-zolazepam provides effective short-term anaesthesia for feral horses, affording a practical and field-accessible capture technique. This method could also be applied to other management actions requiring the safe and humane capture of feral horses.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2014,101071WR14108,"[Zabek, Magdalena A.; Wright, John; Collins, Christina W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia./[Berman, David M.] Queensland Murray Darling Comm, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia./[Hampton, Jordan O.] Ecotone Wildlife Vet Serv, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.","Zabek, MA (reprint author), Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, Bldg 8114, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",10_1071_WR14108

Kelly, L.",NA,NA,NA,"The adoption of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) risk-based trading (RBT) schemes has the potential to reduce the risk of bTB spread. However, any scheme will have cost implications that need to be balanced against its likely success in reducing bTB. This paper describes the first stochastic quantitative model assessing the impact of the implementation of a cattle risk-based trading scheme to inform policy makers and contribute to cost benefit analyses. A risk assessment for England and Wales was developed to estimate the number of infected cattle traded using historic movement data recorded between July 2010 and June 2011. Three scenarios were implemented: cattle traded with no RBT scheme in place, voluntary provision of the score and a compulsory, statutory scheme applying a bTB risk score to each farm. For each scenario, changes in trade were estimated due to provision of the risk score to potential purchasers. An estimated mean of 3981 bTB infected animals were sold to purchasers with no RBT scheme in place in one year, with 90% confidence the true value was between 2775 and 5288. This result is dependent on the estimated between herd prevalence used in the risk assessment which is uncertain. With the voluntary provision of the risk score by farmers, on average, 17% of movements was affected (purchaser did not wish to buy once the risk score was available), with a reduction of 23% in infected animals being purchased initially. The compulsory provision of the risk score in a statutory scheme resulted in an estimated mean change to 26% of movements, with a reduction of 37% in infected animals being purchased initially, increasing to a 53% reduction in infected movements from higher risk sellers (score 4 and 5). The estimated mean reduction in infected animals being purchased could be improved to 45% given a 10% reduction in risky purchase behaviour by farmers which may be achieved through education programmes, or to an estimated mean of 49% if a rule was implemented preventing farmers from the purchase of animals of higher risk than their own herd.
Given voluntary trials currently taking place of a trading scheme, recommendations for future work include the monitoring of initial uptake and changes in the purchase patterns of farmers. Such data could be used to update the risk assessment to reduce uncertainty associated with model estimates. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Feral cats are generally believed to vary their diet according to prey availability; however, no previous studies of diet have tested this hypothesis on insular ecosystems with a limited range of available prey. Because domestic cats kill prey independently of hunger, the spatial extent of their impact on wildlife will be influenced by home-range size. In this study, we combined dietary information with cat movements to assess the impacts of feral and domestic cats on island biodiversity. We quantified the diet of cats from scat samples collected across one year and tested whether diet varies by season. The abundance of main prey categories was also estimated to document seasonal variation in prey availability for cats. Finally, we tracked domestic cats by global positioning system units in all four seasons to examine whether home-range patterns varied seasonally. The diet of cats constituted three prey groups (rodents, birds and invertebrates), and the seasonal variation in consumption of each taxon matched the seasonal variation in prey availability, thus supporting the generalist behaviour of cats on oceanic islands. Roaming behaviour varied among individuals and across seasons, but could not be explained by availability of prey. Unconfined cats had larger home-ranges than confined cats, but most domestic cats strayed <1km from home. Thus, confinement of domestic cats might reduce the spatial extent of cat impact on native prey populations on oceanic islands.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JAN,2014,101111jzo12082,"[Hervias, S.; Ruiz de Ybanez, R.] Univ Murcia, Fac Vet, Dept Anim Hlth, E-30100 Murcia, Spain./[Oppel, S.] Royal Soc Protect Birds, London, England./[Hervias, S.; Medina, F.

We investigated the effectiveness of a small MPA adjacent to Cape Cod, MA (USA) for protecting American horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). We used a fixed acoustic telemetry array to study the spatial ecology of 24 adult horseshoe crabs off the coast of Chatham, Massachusetts, from June 2010 to November 2011. Two groups of horseshoe crabs were tagged in spawning habitats (separated by similar to 2.0 km) with differing commercial harvesting pressure: one group inside Stage Harbor where harvesting is permitted, and the other within Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and the Cape Cod National Seashore (the MPA) where harvesting is prohibited. In the first year of study, crabs tagged in the MPA did not go to Stage Harbor, but instead remained in the MPA and adjacent high-energy beach, whereas crabs tagged in Stage Harbor moved throughout the entire study area. In the second year of study, crabs from both tagging locations used all areas. All crabs generally moved greater distances in the MPA than in other areas, and the majority of movement we recorded was in late spring and summer. All crabs that we tagged used similar areas around Cape Cod. The MPA only provides protection when crabs are in that area, which may only be for a few months of the year. Given that all crabs used Stage Harbor, they were all exposed to potential harvest, but the MPA did provide some protection for all crabs.",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OCT 15,2018,101016jecss201806016,"[Martinez, Sarah E.

Key advantages are the monitoring of (1) elusive species, (2) different taxa simultaneously, (3) large temporal and spatial scales, (4) with reduced human presence and (5) with considerable time saving for data processing. However, terrestrial sound environments can be highly complex; they are very challenging when trying to automatically detect and classify vocalizations because of low signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore, most studies have used manual preselection of high-quality sounds to achieve better classification rates. Consequently, most systems have never been validated under realistic field conditions.
In this study, we evaluated the performance of a passive acoustic monitoring system for four primate species in the highly noisy rain forest environment of the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We collected 12851h of recordings with 20 autonomous recording units and did not preselect high-quality sounds manually. To automatically detect and classify the sounds of interest, we used an automated system built on speaker segmentation, support vector machines and Gaussian mixture models. One hundred and seventy-nine hours of recordings were used for validating the system.
The system performed well in detecting the loud calls of Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos with a recall of 50% and 42%, respectively. Recall rates were lower for Pan troglodytes and Procolobus badius. To determine the presence of Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos with a certainty of P>0999, 2 and 7h of recordings were needed, respectively. For these two species, our automated approach reflected the spatio-temporal distribution of vocalization events well. Despite the seemingly low precision, time investment for the manual removal of false positives in the system's output was only 35% compared to a human collecting and processing the primate vocalization data.
The proposed monitoring system is already fully applicable for Cercopithecus diana and Colobus polykomos, whereas it needs further improvement for the other species tested. In principle, it can be applied to any distinctive animal sound and can be implemented for the collection of acoustic data for behavioural, ecological and conservation studies.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUL,2015,1011112041210X12384,"[Heinicke, Stefanie; Kalan, Ammie K.; Wagner, Oliver J.

Increasing food predictability may lead to the emergence of foraging routines liable to make individuals too dependent on human-mediated feeding. Using recent methodologies (Fourier, Wavelet and conditional entropy-based analyses), we investigated the degree of routine movement behaviour in a population of Eurasian Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) that mostly feed on livestock carrion provided at Supplementary Feeding Stations (SFS). Overall, the levels of routine behaviour were low. Only 10% of the SFS included within an individual's home range were periodically visited for some time, with a period ranging from 1 to 6 days. The closer a SFS to the nest and the higher the frequency of food supply, the more likely was a vulture to visit this SFS periodically. Vultures also tended to repeatedly visit some series of SFS more often than expected if they would forage at random, but the levels of routine remained relatively low. Our results suggest that the management of supplementary food through a network of numerous small SFS does not substantially disrupt the natural foraging behaviour of vultures, whereas large, frequently replenished SFS tend to artificially increase their level of routine. We thus recommend managers to preferentially rely on a system of dilution of carcasses across the environment to protect the opportunistic behaviour typical of wild vultures.",ELSEVIER SCI LTD,NOV,2017,101016jbiocon201707030,"[Fluhr, Julie; Benhamou, Simon; Duriez, Olivier] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France./[Riotte-Lambert, Louise] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.","Fluhr, J (reprint author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",NA

We demonstrate that laboratory evaluations of swimming performance for individual populations are an effective way to describe susceptibility of entrainment. Using a Blazka-type swim tunnel, we quantified positive rheotaxis (head-first orientation into flowing water), endurance (time to fatigue), and behaviour (method of movement) of juvenile sturgeon in water velocities ranging from 10 to 90 cm s(-1). Sturgeon representing four different populations of the United States were tested: two populations of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and two populations of pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus). Lake sturgeon from Lake Winnebago were weaker swimmers than those from the Wisconsin River, and pallid sturgeon from the Yellowstone River were weaker swimmers than those from the Atchafalaya River. Rheotaxis, endurance, and behavioural data were used to calculate an index of entrainment risk, ranging from 0 (unlikely) to 1.00 (inevitable), which was applied to hydraulic models of dredge flow fields. Risk of entrainment varied among populations but for all groups tested, substantial entrainment risk occurred only within a 1.25 m radius of the draghead and this risk could be significantly reduced or eliminated by reducing the diameter of the dredge pipe.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,APR,2011,101111j14390426201101746x,"[Hoover, J.

Various metrics are used to do this, and recently, metrics have been developed that consider both horizontal movement and vertical dive behaviour to better describe the use of the 3-dimensional environment these animals inhabit. However, the efficacy of these different metrics in predicting behavioural state is poorly understood. We used first passage time (2-dimensional) and first bottom time (3-dimensional) analyses on tracks derived from satellite-relayed data loggers to quantify and determine seal behavioural state while foraging at sea. Movement and dive data were collected from 38 southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina from Macquarie and Campbell Islands (in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean). Using a suite of environmental variables, linear mixed-effect models were derived for the 2 broad habitats visited by the seals: shelf and open ocean. The best-fitting models for each foraging metric in each habitat were then compared using a cross validation analysis to identify which foraging metric produced the best predictions of habitat use. In shelf habitats, the 3-dimensional foraging metric provided better predictions than the 2-dimensional metric, while the 2-dimensional foraging metric resulted in the best predictive capacity in the open ocean habitats. These findings highlight the importance of considering the appropriate foraging metrics when modelling foraging behaviour.",INTER-RESEARCH,DEC 29,2016,103354meps11947,"[Pascoe, Penelope; Lea, Mary-Anne; McMahon, Clive R.; Hindell, Mark A.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point 7004, Australia./[Lea, Mary-Anne; Hindell, Mark A.] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst CRC, Level 3, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia./[Mattlin, Rob H.] Marine Wildlife Res, Nelson 7050, New Zealand./[McMahon, Clive R.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia./[Harcourt, Robert] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia./[Thompson, David] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington 6021, New Zealand./[Torres, Leigh] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Marine Mammal Inst, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97365 USA./[Vinette-Herrin, Kimberly] Taronga Conservat Soc, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia.","Pascoe, P (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point 7004, Australia.",10_3354_meps11947

More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (n = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014-2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (>5 m.s(-1); HSR) and relative distance covered (m.min(-1)) over 60-300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 +/- 20.6 m.min(-1) in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 +/- 13.3 m.min(-1) for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m.min(-1), 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m.min(-1)). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p < 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p < 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (similar to 11%) and HSR values (up to similar to 20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60-300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 5,2018,101371journalpone0195197,"[Cunningham, Daniel J.; Cook, Christian J.; Kilduff, Liam P.] Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Appl Sport Technol Exercise & Med Res Ctr A STEM, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Shearer, David A.] Univ South Wales, Sch Psychol & Therapeut Studies, Pontypridd, Wales./[Shearer, David A.; Kilduff, Liam P.] Swansea Univ, Welsh Inst Performance Sci, Coll Engn, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Carter, Neil] Swansea Univ, Dept Psychol, Coll Human & Hlth Sci, Swansea, W Glam, Wales./[Drawer, Scott] Team Sky, Sky Performance Hub, London, England./[Pollard, Ben] Saracens RFC, North London, England./[Bennett, Mark; Eager, Robin] Rugby Football Union, Greater London, England./[Cook, Christian J.] Univ Canberra, Res Inst Sport & Exercise, Canberra, ACT, Australia./[Farrell, John] Georgian Rugby Union, Tbilisi, Rep of Georgia./[Russell, Mark] Leeds Trinity Univ, Sch Social & Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.","Kilduff, LP (reprint author), Swansea Univ, Coll Engn, Appl Sport Technol Exercise & Med Res Ctr A STEM, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.; Kilduff, LP (reprint author), Swansea Univ, Welsh Inst Performance Sci, Coll Engn, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",10_1371_journal_pone_0195197

Additionally, repeated high intensity efforts, player load and exertion index were investigated. The analysis using paired samples t-test and percentage typical error of measurement (%TEM) revealed that 10 Hz GPS units provided a valid and reliable measure of TD (p>0.05, % TEM=1.3). The 5 Hz units also displayed reliable measures of TD (% TEM=1.2). It was apparent that as the speed of movement increased, the level of GPS error increased for both 5 Hz and 10 Hz units (% TEM: 0-14%). The updates in GPS firmware and increased sampling rates have further improved the validity and inter-unit reliability of GPS. Consequently, practitioners can more confidently rely on the data obtained from current GPS units during training and matches, however, caution is required when measuring high speed movements.","UNIV WALES INST, CARDIFF",APR,2013,nodoi8277565473,"[Johnston, Richard J.; Watsford, Mark L.; Sporri, Daniel] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia./[Pine, Matthew J.; Spurrs, Robert W.] Sydney Swans Football Club, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","Johnston, RJ (reprint author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",NA

Issues today include logging frequency and precision in estimating space use and travel distances, as well as battery life and cost. We developed a low-cost (similar to US$125), open-source GPS datalogger based on Arduino. To test the system, we collected positions at 20-s intervals for several 1-week durations from cattle and sheep on rangeland in North Dakota. We tested two questions of broad interest to ecologists who use GPS collars to track animal movements: (1) How closely do collared animals cluster in their herd? (2) How well do different logging patterns estimate patch occupancy and total daily distance traveled? Tested logging patterns included regular logging (one position every 5 or 10min), and burst logging (positions recorded at 20-s intervals for 5 or 10min per hour followed by a sleep period). Collared sheep within the same pasture spent 75% of daytime periods within 51m of each other (mean=42m); collared cattle were within 111m (mean=76m). In our comparison of how well different logging patterns estimate space use versus constant logging, the proportion of positions recorded in 1- and 16-ha patches differed by 2%-3% for burst logging and 1% for regular logging. Although all logging patterns underestimated total daily distance traveled, underestimations were corrected by multiplying estimations by regression coefficients estimated by maximum likelihood. Burst logging can extend battery life by a factor of 7. We conclude that a minimum of two collars programmed with burst logging robustly estimate patch use and spatial distribution of grazing livestock herds. Research questions that require accurately estimating travel of individual animals, however, are probably best addressed with regular logging intervals and will thus have greater battery demands than spatial occupancy questions across all GPS datalogger systems.",WILEY,JUN,2018,101002ece34094,"[McGranahan, Devan Allen; Spiess, Jonathan W.] North Dakota State Univ, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA./[Geaumont, Benjamin] Hettinger Res Extens Ctr, Hettinger, ND USA.","McGranahan, DA (reprint author), North Dakota State Univ, Sch Nat Resource Sci, Fargo, ND 58105 USA.",10_1002_ece3_4094

With this information, it is possible to assess the circadian rhythm of activity and monitor its response to internal and external factors. Identifying irregularities in this rhythm may indicate animal health and welfare issues. The aim of this study was to collect sensor-based general activity and investigate circadian rhythm of this activity to identify the changes due to weather influences that act on these parameters throughout the year; to identify the differences between individuals; and to assess links between general activity and circadian rhythm of activity with sheep body weight change. In total, 29 Scottish Blackface ewes of different ages and body condition scores were used. The animals were monitored for four consecutive weeks in each of four seasonal periods, in extensive systems on Scottish upland pastures, and without human handling during study periods. Accelerometer-integrated collars were fitted to the animals to collect motion index continuously every minute. These data were used to calculate the percentage of cyclic behaviour that was harmonic/synchronized with the environment (over 24 h period), as Degree of Functional Coupling (DFC). The DFC was shown within rolling seven-day periods. Low DFCs indicate low synchronization. Weather data were collected daily. Random regression models were used to assess between-individual variation. During the winter period, the level of the DFC for the activity of nineteen ewes lowered in response to a period of high level of precipitation combined with low winter temperatures. However, four ewes exhibited a lower level of variation in the DFC values, showing that there were differences between individuals in regard to their response to the precipitation level. The overall mean of the DFC for the general activity was highest in autumn (95.4%, P < 0.001), however, it did not differ between summer and spring (respectively 90.2% and 88.1%, P > 0.05), but was significantly lower during the winter (81.7%, P < 0.001) compared with summer and autumn. Over the spring and summer, variation in DFC was a good estimator of body weight gain. It was concluded that the assessment of circadian rhythms of general activity using the DFC-parameter allows a better understanding of sheep responses to weather influences, compared to the evaluation of general activity alone. The random regression model method was effective in identifying animals that deviated positively or negatively from population responses.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,OCT,2018,101016japplanim201806007,"[Sarout, Bruna Nunes Marsiglio; Waterhouse, Anthony; Duthie, Carol-Anne; Haskell, Marie J.] Scotlands Rural Coll, West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland./[Sarout, Bruna Nunes Marsiglio; Poli, Cesar Henrique Espirito Candal] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Agron, Av Bento Goncalves 7712, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil./[Berger, Anne] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany./[Umstatter, Christina] Agroscope, Tanikon 1, CH-8356 Ettenhausen, Switzerland.","Sarout, BNM (reprint author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Fac Agron, Av Bento Goncalves 7712, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",NA

We tested this hypothesis by exploring the relationships between sea lion population trends, fishery catches, and the prey biomass accessible to sea lions around 33 rookeries between 2000 and 2008. We focused on three commercially important species that have dominated the sea lion diet during the population decline: walleye pollock, Pacific cod and Atka mackerel. We estimated available prey biomass by removing fishery catches from predicted prey biomass distributions in the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska; and modelled the likelihood of sea lions foraging at different distances from rookeries (accessibility) using satellite telemetry locations of tracked animals. We combined this accessibility model with the prey distributions to estimate the prey biomass accessible to sea lions by rookery. For each rookery, we compared sea lion population change to accessible prey biomass. Of 304 comparisons, we found 3 statistically significant relationships, all suggesting that sea lion populations increased with increasing prey accessibility.

The heart rates of 145 limpets of different sizes, living on vertical and horizontal substrata, were measured both in air and water at different environmental temperatures, while the animals were inactive on their home scars. The heart rates of emersed, inactive limpets were positively related to air temperature and negatively related to limpet size. These relationships were similar for limpets on vertical and horizontal substrates. In contrast, no significant relationship between heart rate and temperature was found in submerged limpets, probably due to the narrow thermal range of the water during the study period. During submersion, a significant negative relationship between heart rate and size was evident for limpets on vertical surfaces but not for limpets on horizontal surfaces. In general, submerged limpets had a higher heart rate, 1.16 times that of limpets exposed to air. Moreover, the heart rates of nine animals were recorded while they were moving and while inactive on their home scars. Active limpets had a faster heart rate, 1.6 times that of limpets resting on their home scars. The dependence of heart rate on environmental temperature, size, respiratory medium and activity, as observed in limpets on the shore, agrees well with laboratory data and with previous findings of the correlation of oxygen consumption with the same factors.

Dispersal contributes to spatio-temporal variation in population size and is a key process in studies of life history evolution and studies with conservation implications. However, dispersal is still one of the major gaps in our knowledge of ecological dynamics. The very large literature on metapopulation dynamics lacks empirical bases on dispersal and relevant behavioural parameters. We used multistate capture-recapture models (data from 1988 to 2001) to address hypotheses about movement probability and habitat selection within a system of two breeding colonies in Audouin's gulls (Larus audouinii), an endemic species breeding in the Mediterranean and considered as threatened.
2. Movement probability varied over time, and differed greatly between the colonies.
3. We did not find evidence of an influence of colony size or density of predators on movement probability.
4. In dispersers, our results did not support the hypotheses that movement probability between year t and t + 1 was influenced by mean breeding success in the colony of origin (i.e. an indicator of habitat quality) or the destination colony in year t or t + 1, or by the ratio of breeding success in these colonies in year t or t + 1 (i.e. quality gradient).
5. Overall, movement probability was higher from the smaller colony to the larger, and from the colony with lower breeding success in year t to the more productive one. This provides slight support for two nonexclusive hypotheses about habitat selection (conspecific attraction and conspecific success attraction).
6. Movement probability from the smaller, less productive colony was very high in some years, suggesting that the dynamics of both colonies were strongly influenced by adult dispersal. However, in absolute numbers, more individuals moved from the larger, more productive colony to the smaller one. This suggests that the system may function as a source-sink system.
7. Use of multistate models to re-assess local survival showed that survival was lower in the less productive colony with higher emigration probability. This may reflect genuine differences in mortality between colonies, or more probably differences in permanent emigration from the study area.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUL,2004,101111j00218790200400848x,"Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, CNRS, UMR 5174, F-31062 Toulouse 04, France./UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain./CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France./Direcc Gen Planificac & Gest Medio, Serv Conservac & Gest Biodivers, Valencia 46011, Spain.","Cam, E (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 3, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, CNRS, UMR 5174, Bat 4R3,Salle 209,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 04, France.",NA

The latest generation of these devices feature multiple sensors, ostensibly similar or even superior to advanced research instruments. However, little is known about the accuracy of their energy expenditure estimates. Here, we assessed their performance against criterion measurements in both controlled laboratory conditions (simulated activities of daily living and structured exercise) and over a 24 hour period in free-living conditions. Thirty men (n = 15) and women (n = 15) wore three multi-sensor consumer monitors (Microsoft Band, Apple Watch and Fitbit Charge HR), an accelerometry-only device as a comparison (Jawbone UP24) and validated research-grade multi-sensor devices (BodyMedia Core and individually calibrated Actiheart (TM)). During discrete laboratory activities when compared against indirect calorimetry, the Apple Watch performed similarly to criterion measures. The Fitbit Charge HR was less consistent at measurement of discrete activities, but produced similar free-living estimates to the Apple Watch. Both these devices underestimated free-living energy expenditure (-394 kcal/d and -405 kcal/d, respectively; P<0.01). The multi-sensor Microsoft Band and accelerometry-only Jawbone UP24 devices underestimated most laboratory activities and substantially underestimated free-living expenditure (-1128 kcal/d and -998 kcal/d, respectively; P<0.01). None of the consumer devices were deemed equivalent to the reference method for daily energy expenditure. For all devices, there was a tendency for negative bias with greater daily energy expenditure. No consumer monitors performed as well as the research-grade devices although in some (but not all) cases, estimates were close to criterion measurements. Thus, whilst industry-led innovation has improved the accuracy of consumer monitors, these devices are not yet equivalent to the best research-grade devices or indeed equivalent to each other. We propose independent quality standards and/or accuracy ratings for consumer devices are required.",NA,FEB 24,2017,101371journalpone0171720,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0171720

Code division multiple access (CDMA) technology enabled the simultaneous monitoring of the 20 transmitters (equipped with pressure and temperature sensors) at 15 s intervals with sub-meter accuracy. Fish were monitored between November 2003 and April 2004 to evaluate the behaviour of fish across different temporal and spatial scales. The distance moved by largemouth bass, assessed both on a daily and hourly basis, varied by season and was positively correlated with water temperature. For example, daily movement rates were 2.69 +/- 1.45 km/day in mid November (average daily water temperature 5.9 degrees C), 2.24 +/- 0.73 km/day in early January (5.1 degrees C), and 7.28 +/- 2.62 km/day in mid April (7.7 degrees C). Interestingly, daily movement rates varied by as much as 25 fold among individual fish. Visualization of fish swimming paths revealed that whereas some fish occupied discrete areas and made only localized movements, other individuals made lengthier journeys covering much of the lake in periods of as little as one day. Analysis of fish behaviour at a finer temporal scale revealed that during the winter, fish spend more than 95% of their time swimming at speeds less than 0.1 m/s (0.07 +/- 0.24 m/s). During late fall, and especially in spring, swimming speeds were higher with mean swimming speeds of 0.11 +/- 0.27 m/s and 0.19 +/- 0.29 m/s, respectively. When the telemetry dataset was queried to simulate 24 h manual tracking intervals, it was clear that manual tracking data would not have been representative of actual daily movement rates, underestimating daily movement and swimming speeds by at least 75 fold. This study identifies the importance of evaluating fish activity at multiple spatial (whole lake to sub-meter position) and temporal (seasonal to seconds) scales and illustrates the potential of CDMA telemetry to yield such data.",SPRINGER,MAY,2007,101007s1075000605496,"Carleton Univ, Ottawa Carleton Inst Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada./Queens Univ, Dept Geog, Geog Informat Syst Lab, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada./Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Biol Stn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada./Lotek Wireless Inc, Newmarket, ON L3Y 7B5, Canada./Univ Illinois, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA./Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Aquat Ecol & Conservat, Champaign, IL 61820 USA./Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada./Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada./Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Harkness Lab Fisheries Res, Peterborough, ON K9J 8M5, Canada.","Hanson, KC (reprint author), Carleton Univ, Ottawa Carleton Inst Biol, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",10_1007_s10750_006_0549_6

During the study, 19 of the 23 tagged trout were relocated by eight to 20 times (mean: 15 relocations per fish) in Frnz Stream. The time between the tracking surveys and relocations varied from 21 to 44days (mean: 30days) and the mean distance between relocations was 151m (26 to 881m). Tagged trout showed a distribution within a distance of 9350m in Frnz Stream. 95% of the relocations clustered at a distance of 4500m, while 75 and 50% of them were distributed at a distance of 1935m and 1488m, respectively. The linear home range of the individual ranged from 199 to 5087m (mean 792m), whereas mean 95% Kernel Density Home Range (KDHR), 75% KDHR, and mean core range (50% KDHR), were 632m, 477m and 290m, respectively. The depths and velocities of the locations where tagged trout occurred varied from 20 to 185cm (mean depth: 43cm) and 11 to 240cm/s (mean velocity: 45.9cm/s). There was no correlation between fish size and depth and fish size and velocity. Hydropower stations and trout farms negatively affected movement of the brown trout in the stream. The fish passage in Frnz Hydropower Station (HPP) is inefficient due to low water mark downstream.

Methods: One hundred and fifty two individuals with intellectual disabilities aged 12-70 years from East and South-East England. Physical activity levels in counts per minute (counts/min), steps per day (steps/day), and minutes of sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured with a uni-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT1M) for seven days.
Results: No individuals with intellectual disabilities met current physical activity recommendations. Males were more active than females. There was a trend for physical activity to decline and sedentary behaviour to increase with age, and for those with more severe levels of intellectual disability to be more sedentary and less physically active, however any relationship was not significant when adjusted for confounding variables. Participants with Down's syndrome engaged in significantly less physical activity than those with intellectual disabilities without Down's syndrome and levels of activity declined significantly with age.
Conclusions: Individuals with intellectual disabilities, especially those with Down's syndrome may be at risk of developing diseases associated with physical inactivity. There is a need for well-designed, accessible, preventive health promotion strategies and interventions designed to raise the levels of physical activity for individuals with intellectual disabilities. We propose that there are physiological reasons why individuals with Down's syndrome have particularly low levels of physical activity that also decline markedly with age.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,DEC 21,2011,101371journalpone0028618,"[Phillips, Alexander C.; Holland, Anthony J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge, England.","Phillips, AC (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge, England.",10_1371_journal_pone_0028618

However, our understanding of these behaviors in large mammalian systems is poorly developed. To address the relationship between predator selection patterns, prey density, and prey vulnerability, we quantified selection patterns for two fine-scale behaviors of a recovering wolf (Canis lupus) population in Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming, USA. Wolf spatial data were collected between November and May from 1998-1999 until 2001-2002. Over four winters, 244 aerial locations, 522 ground-based telemetry locations, 1287 km of movement data from snow tracking, and the locations of 279 wolf kill sites were recorded. There was evidence that elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) densities had a weak effect on the sites where wolves traveled and made kills. Wolf movements showed a strong selection for geothermal areas, meadows, and areas near various types of habitat edges. Proximity to edge and habitat class also had a strong influence on the locations where elk were most vulnerable to predation. There was little evidence that wolf kill sites differed from the places where wolves traveled, indicating that elk vulnerability influenced where wolves selected to-travel. Our results indicate that elk are more Vulnerable to wolves under certain conditions and that wolves are capable of selecting for these conditions. As such, vulnerability plays a central role in predator-prey behavioral games and can potentially impact the systems to which they relate.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,FEB,2006,101890041532,"Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA./Montana State Univ, Dept Stat & Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA./Calif State Univ Monterey Bay, Watershed Inst, Seaside, CA 93955 USA.","Bergman, EJ (reprint author), Colorado Div Wildlife, 2300 S Townsend Ave, Montrose, CO 81401 USA.",NA

Studies of this opponent assessment function have generated important insights into signal design and evolution. In the case of sounds, rate of production is often a salient feature. We used digital video playback to conduct analogous experiments exploring the importance of temporal variation in visual signals. Our study focused on the push-up display of male Jacky dragons Amphibolurus muricatus, an Australian agamid lizard. This stereotyped movement-based signal is commonly performed during male - male contests. A previous study has shown that Jacky dragons responses are influenced by the overall display rate of a video conspecific. We built upon this finding by investigating the effect of short-term variation in display rate. Each playback sequence varied systematically across a different combination of display parameters, while keeping the total number of push-ups constant. Other potential cues, such as morphology and the characteristics of individual motor patterns, were precisely controlled. The aggressive signalling and locomotor behaviour of subject males varied significantly between sequences. Most notably, performance of throat expansions, a typical agamid threat posture, was suppressed by video sequences with temporal clumping of displays. These results show that lizards are sensitive to differences in the temporal fine structure of display sequences and suggest that display concentration is an important assessment cue.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,SEP 1,2007,101242jeb007492,"Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia./Macquarie Univ, Dept Psychol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.","Van Dyk, DA (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",NA

Several methods quantify how individuals concentrate their search effort along a given path. Among these, First-Passage Time (FPT) analysis is particularly useful to identify transitions in movement patterns (e.g. between searching and feeding). This method has mainly been applied to terrestrial animals or flying seabirds that have little or no vertical component to their foraging, so we examined the differences between classic FPT and a modification of this approach using the time spent at the bottom of a dive for characterizing the foraging activity of a diving predator: the southern elephant seal.
2. Satellite relayed data loggers were deployed on 20 individuals during three successive summers at the Kerguelen Islands, providing a total of 72 978 dives from eight juvenile males and nine adult females.
3. Spatial scales identified using the time spent at the bottom of a dive ((omega) over bar = 68.2 +/- 42.1 km) were smaller than those obtained by the classic FPT analysis ((omega) over bar = 104.7 +/- 67.3 km). Moreover, foraging areas identified using the new approach clearly overlapped areas where individuals increased their body condition, indicating that it accurately reflected the foraging activity of the seals.
4. These results suggest that incorporating the vertical dimension into FPT provides a different result to the surface path alone. Close to the Antarctic continent, within the pack-ice, sinuosity of the path could be explained by a high sea-ice concentration (restricting elephant seal movements), and was not necessarily related to foraging activity.
5. Our approach distinguished between actual foraging activity and changes in behaviour induced by the physical environment like sea ice, and could be applied to other diving predators. Inclusion of diving parameters appears to be essential to identify the spatial scale of foraging areas of diving animals.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,SEP,2008,101111j13652656200801407x,"[Bailleul, Frederic; Pinaud, David; Guinet, Christophe] CNRS, Ctr Etudes Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France./[Hindell, Mark] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Antarctic Wildlife Res Unit, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia./[Charrassin, Jean-Benolt] Museum Natl Hist Nat, DMPA, Equipe Phys Ocean Austral, F-75231 Paris, France.","Bailleul, F (reprint author), CNRS, Ctr Etudes Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",NA

CONTESTS; EVOLUTION; GAME; COMMUNICATION; INTENTIONS; RESPONSES",NA,"Game theory predicts that at least some of the behaviour patterns displayed during aggressive encounters are used to assess asymmetries in variables that indicate fighting ability and resource value. Game theoretical models such as the sequential assessment game see assessment as the major activity during a fight. However, while these models acknowledge the existence of physical and motivational assessment parameters, there are only a few examples where a mechanism for the assessment of fighting readiness has been shown. In staged encounters between male Mediterranean field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, fighting behaviour follows a stereotyped escalation cascade with ritualized displays in the beginning and physical combat towards the end. Despite their larger size, heavier animals lost 30% of the encounters even if weight asymmetry was large. To examine whether the contestants provide assessment cues that might explain this surprising result, we analysed two stereotyped displays in detail (antennal fencing and mandible spreading). The duration of antennal fencing, which is necessary to initiate a fight, was independent of experience and weight asymmetry between the contestants, but was prolonged after shortening the antennae by almost 90%. Fights escalated only when antennal movement frequencies were high in both contestants. In blinded crickets few contests were settled by another ritualized display, mandible spreading, and fights that escalated beyond this stage were significantly shorter than in untreated crickets. We suggest that antennal fencing may be used to assess fighting readiness of the opponent, while mandible spreading may indicate fighting ability. We conclude that high willingness to fight may help crickets to overcome inferior fighting ability.

Rehabilitation centres aim to care for these monkeys and ultimately return them to the wild whenever possible. However, it is unknown whether rehabilitation is successful in its goal of creating wild-living, independent, self-sustaining troops due to limited published research in this area. This study describes the release and subsequent fate of a troop of rehabilitated vervet monkeys over a 6-month period. A troop of 16 monkeys was released into the Ntendeka Wilderness Area, a protected part of Ngome Forest, by the WATCH (Wild Animal Trauma Centre and Haven) rehabilitation centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Monitoring data were evaluated with regard to survival, mortality, suitability of the release site, breeding, condition, troop composition, behaviour, group dynamics, ranging patterns and the effectiveness of monitoring tools. The release was considered to be a partial success in that the troop exhibited behaviour, group dynamics and ranging patterns similar to wild conspecifics. However, the survival rate was low and the troop was judged to be non-self-sustaining. The main problems identified were the limited lifetimes of radio collars, which resulted in missing animals and caused monitoring to be cut short, illegal hunting activities, predation and a small troop size with few adults. The authors recommend improvements that may increase success, such as retaining troops in release enclosures for longer periods, releasing a larger troop with more adults that more closely matches wild troop composition, selecting a release site at least 3 km from the nearest human settlement and the use of GPS collars to allow for a longer monitoring period encompassing all seasonal conditions. Furthermore, all primates for release should be medically screened so as to avoid potential negative impacts on wild populations.",SPRINGER TOKYO,APR,2012,101007s1032901102920,"[Guy, Amanda J.; Stone, Olivia M.

SfM-MVS topographic models, including Digital Surface Models (DSM) and dense point clouds, were compared against RTK-GPS point data and a pre-existing airborne LiDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Results indicate that UAV SfM-MVS can deliver topographic models with a resolution and accuracy suitable to define gully systems at a hillslope scale (e.g., approximately 0.1 m resolution with 0.4-1.2 m elevation error), while ground-based SfM-MVS is more capable of quantifying gully morphology (e.g., approximately 0.01 m resolution with 0.04-0.1 m elevation error).

These models are frequently examined using experimental transplants in which animals are moved to levels (or habitats) where they are not usually found and their movements subsequently monitored. There are many problems with the design, execution and interpretation of most of these studies because of lack of appropriate experimental design and inadequate analyses to identify interactions among variables. This study examined the role of behaviour in determining patterns of distribution of two small periwinkles, Littorina unifasciata Gray and Nodilittorina pyramidalis (Quoy and Gaimard) on rocky shores in New South Wales, Australia, using experimental transplantations. Also examined were the experimental and analytical procedures necessary for such experiments and spatial and temporal variability in results obtained. N. pyramidalis and L. unifasciata responded to being transplanted downshore or, for L. unifasciata only, upshore by dispersing further and moving directionally towards their level of origin. These responses were persistent and relatively widespread across many sites. There was considerable variability in the results obtained from place to place and time to time, although transplanted snails were less variable in behaviour than were snails in other treatments or controls. Translocation to a different site at the same level on the shore caused snails to disperse longer mean distances, although not as far as moved by transplanted snails, but did not have a consistent effect on directionality of movement. Experiments such as these must include controls for disturbance and translocation if responses of transplanted animals are to be appropriately interpreted. They must also include proper design and replication so that variability in responses from site to site, day to day and among similar experiments can be quantified. Only then can processes influencing such behaviour be investigated and the role of behaviour in determining patterns be understood. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

To minimize effects on animal behavior, ecotourism operations must be carefully managed. Local management efforts that can be tailored to the specific area and animals may be more successful than broad-scale efforts that may be unknown to users of the environment, or inappropriate for the species. A profitable and growing whale-watch industry exists in Oregon, USA, but prior to this project, no state guidelines existed to protect animals and maintain sustainability of the industry. This project integrated research and outreach regarding gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) behavioral response to vessels, and translated results into community-developed vessel operation guidelines. We tracked whales and vessels in summer 2015 using non-invasive, shore-based theodolite and photo identification techniques. We monitored 2 sites along the Oregon coast with differing levels of vessel traffic for 4 weeks each. We analyzed tracks of whales using Markov chains to assess behavior state changes relative to location, individual, vessel presence, vessel type, and distance between whale and vessel. We documented significant differences in gray whale activity budgets between control and impact conditions, and between study sites. We did not observe significant differences in individual responses to vessel disturbance. Researchers and stakeholders collaboratively applied these results to create scientifically informed vessel operation guidelines that aim to balance the economic and educational gains of a whale-watch industry with adequate protection of the exploited whale population to enhance sustainability.

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4).
Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed.
Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were nonsignificant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance.
Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential use of mobile accelerometry to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy individuals.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,AUG 10,2011,101371journalpone0023299,"[Schimpl, Michaela; Lederer, Christian; Neuhaus, Anneke; Daumer, Martin] Human Mot Inst, Sylvia Lawry Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res eV, Munich, Germany./[Schimpl, Michaela; Daumer, Martin] Trium Anal Online GmbH, Munich, Germany./[Moore, Carmel; Danesh, John] Univ Cambridge, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Cambridge, England./[Sambrook, Jennifer; Ouwehand, Willem] Univ Cambridge, Dept Haematol, Cambridge, England./[Sambrook, Jennifer; Ouwehand, Willem] NHS Blood & Transplant, Cambridge, England.","Schimpl, M (reprint author), Human Mot Inst, Sylvia Lawry Ctr Multiple Sclerosis Res eV, Munich, Germany.",10_1371_journal_pone_0023299

From over 5000 sets of synchronized location records we calculated distances between all possible dyads of active lizards, and constructed binary social networks based on close associations between individuals. We compared empirical networks with a null model network for spatially structured populations that assumed random movement within lizard home ranges. We showed significantly lower network degree (i.e. fewer cases of individuals associating) in the observed network than in the null model, and deduced avoidance between some individuals. We found the predominant form of social organization was pair living, and, contrary to previous reports, we found pair associations persisted after mating had finished. Thus, the network analysis revealed a cryptic social organization, which cannot be explained by either biparental care or mate guarding, but may instead relate to refuge site distributions, enhanced vigilance or efficient location of mates in subsequent seasons.

Little work has been done examining the relationship between weather and physical activity, and potential modifiers of any relationship in older people. We therefore examined the relationship between weather and physical activity in a cohort of older community-dwelling people.
Methods: We analysed prospectively collected cross-sectional activity data from community-dwelling people aged 65 and over in the Physical Activity Cohort Scotland. We correlated seven day triaxial accelerometry data with daily weather data (temperature, day length, sunshine, snow, rain), and a series of potential effect modifiers were tested in mixed models: environmental variables (urban vs rural dwelling, percentage of green space), psychological variables (anxiety, depression, perceived behavioural control), social variables (number of close contacts) and health status measured using the SF-36 questionnaire.
Results: 547 participants, mean age 78.5 years, were included in this analysis. Higher minimum daily temperature and longer day length were associated with higher activity levels; these associations remained robust to adjustment for other significant associates of activity: age, perceived behavioural control, number of social contacts and physical function. Of the potential effect modifier variables, only urban vs rural dwelling and the SF-36 measure of social functioning enhanced the association between day length and activity; no variable modified the association between minimum temperature and activity.
Conclusions: In older community dwelling people, minimum temperature and day length were associated with objectively measured activity.

Fifty-four coaches of female soccer teams from Oregon and Washington states (USA) completed a web-based survey. Associations between team age (U9-U14 teams=57 and U15-U19 teams=19 teams) and coaches' (a) attitudes and perceptions; and (b) injury prevention program awareness, adoption, and implementation fidelity were assessed. Coaches of U15-U19 teams perceived injuries to be more of a problem and soccer to present a high risk of injury. Coaches of older teams more strongly agreed that preventive exercises should be performed by their players during training. Injury prevention program awareness among coaches of U15-U19 and U9-U14 age groups was 79% and 60%, respectively. Injury prevention program-aware coaches of U15-U19 teams were more likely to use an injury prevention program than injury prevention program-aware coaches of U9-U14 teams (67% vs. 38%), but they were not more likely to do so with high fidelity (60% vs. 54%). Team age is associated with coaches' short-term perceptions of injury risk, but not perceptions about the long-term ramifications of injury.

Aging is associated with a progressive decrease in bone mass (BM), and being physical active is one of the main strategies to combat this continuous loss. Nonetheless, because daily time is limited, time spent on each movement behavior is co-dependent. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between BM and movement behaviors in elderly people using compositional data analysis.
Methods
We analyzed 871 older people [395 men (76.9 +/- 5.3y) and 476 women (76.7 +/- 4.7y)]. Time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was assessed using accelerometry. BM was determined by bone densitometry (DXA). The sample was divided according to sex and bone health indicators.
Results
The combined effect of all movement behaviors (PA and SB) was significantly associated with whole body, leg and femoral region BM in the whole sample (p<0.05), with leg and pelvic BM (p<0.05) in men and, with whole body, arm and leg BM (p<0.05) in women. In men, arm and pelvic BM were negatively associated with SB and whole body, pelvic and leg BM were positively associated with MVPA (p<0.05). In women, whole body and leg BM were positively associated with SB. Arm and whole body BM were positively associated and leg BM was negatively associated with LPA and arm BM was negatively associated with MVPA (p<0.05). Women without bone fractures spent less time in SB and more in LPA and MVPA than the subgroup with bone fractures.
Conclusion
We identified that the positive effect of MVPA relative to the other behaviors on bone mass is the strongest overall effect in men. Furthermore, women might decrease bone fracture risk through PA increase and SB reduction, despite the fact that no clear benefits of PA for bone mass were found.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,OCT 22,2018,101371journalpone0206013,"[Rodriguez-Gomez, Irene; Manas, Asier; Losa-Reyna, Jose; Rodriguez-Manas, Leocadio; Alegre, Luis M.; Garcia-Garcia, Francisco J.; Ara, Ignacio] GIBER Frailty & Hlth Aging CIBERFES, Madrid, Spain./[Manas, Asier; Losa-Reyna, Jose; Alegre, Luis M.; Ara, Ignacio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, GENUD Toledo Res Grp, Toledo, Spain./[Losa-Reyna, Jose; Garcia-Garcia, Francisco J.] Virgen Valle Hosp, Geriatr Dept, Toledo, Spain./[Rodriguez-Manas, Leocadio] Univ Hosp Getafe, Geriatr Dept, Getafe, Spain./[Chastin, Sebastien F.

Physical activity and physical performance relate to quality of life, mortality, and morbidity in elderly people. However, little is known about differences in physical performance related to low-intensity light physical activity (LLPA), high-intensity light physical activity (HLPA), and moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) and how they are separated by sex in elderly populations.
Aims
This study aimed to determine differences in LLPA, HLPA, MPA, and physical performance, and associations between these measures in community-dwelling elderly men and women.
Methods
Physical activity and physical performance such as timed-up-and-go test, one-leg standing time, and maximum gait speed were measured in 181 community-dwelling elderly men (mean age, 75.1 +/- 5.3 years) and 109 women (mean age, 73.4 +/- 4.8 years) in 2013. Physical activity was classified as LLPA (1.6 +/- 1.9 METs of physical activity), HLPA (2.0 similar to 2.9 METs of physical activity), and MPA (over 3 METs of physical activity). The association between the values of these three intensities of physical activity in the participants was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficients. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the association of physical performance values with the three groups defined by accelerometer- measured physical activity intensity adjusted for sociographic, behavioral, and multiple diseases in the participants.
Results
MPA was beneficially associated with all physical performance indicators in the men (all P < 0.05) and women (all P < 0.05). Only HLPA showed significant associations with the timed-up-and-go test (P = 0.001) and maximum gait speed (P = 0.006) in women. Discussion These results may support the notion that not only HLPA in women but MPA in both sexes appears to improve physical performance in elderly populations. Conclusion The present study findings provide novel epidemiological evidence for the potential benefits of HLPA in women and also reinforce the potential benefits of MPA in both sexes, which is the mainstay of public health recommendations.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 9,2017,101371journalpone0178654,"[Izawa, Kazuhiro P.] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Hlth Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan./[Shibata, Ai] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Hlth & Sport Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan./[Ishii, Kaori; Miyawaki, Rina; Oka, Koichiro] Waseda Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.","Oka, K (reprint author), Waseda Univ, Fac Sport Sci, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan.",10_1371_journal_pone_0178654

Sedentary behavior is related to increased mortality risk. Whether such elevated risk can be offset by enhanced physical activity has not been examined using accelerometry data.
Materials and Methods
We examined the relations of sedentary time and physical activity to mortality from any cause using accelerometry data among 1,677 women and men aged 50 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 cycle with follow-up through December 31, 2006.
Results
During an average follow-up of 34.67 months and 4,845.42 person-years, 112 deaths occurred. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, greater sedentary time (>= median of 8.60 hours/day) was associated with increased risk of mortality from any cause (relative risk (RR) = 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-3.81). Low level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (< median of 6.60 minutes/day) was also related to enhanced allcause mortality risk (RR = 3.30; 95% CI = 1.33-8.17). In combined analyses, greater time spent sedentary and low levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity predicted a substantially elevated all-cause mortality risk. As compared with the combination of a low sedentary level and a high level of moderate to vigorous physical activity, the risks of mortality from all causes were 4.38 (95% CI = 1.26-15.16) for low levels of both sedentary time and physical activity, 2.79 (95% CI = 0.77-10.12) for greater time spent sedentary and high physical activity level, and 7.79 (95% CI = 2.26-26.82) for greater time spent sedentary and low physical activity level. The interaction term between sedentary time and moderate to vigorous physical activity was not statistically significant (p = 0.508).
Conclusions
Both high levels of sedentary time and low levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity are strong and independent predictors of early death from any cause. Whether a high physical activity level removes the increased risk of all-cause mortality related to sedentariness requires further investigation.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 13,2015,101371journalpone0119591,"[Schmid, Daniela; Ricci, Cristian; Leitzmann, Michael F.] Univ Regensburg, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.","Schmid, D (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Franz Josef Str Allee 11, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",10_1371_journal_pone_0119591

Our results suggest that yellowfin and bigeye tuna have longer FAD residence times than skipjack tuna. The survival curves based on the continuous residence times for bigeye and skipjack tuna were best explained by single exponential models, indicating time-independent associative processes and characteristic timescales of 4.3 and 0.9 d, respectively. Continuous residence times of yellowfin tuna were best explained by time-dependent power law models, but the single exponential model (characteristic timescale of 6.5 d) also fit the data well. The analysis of absence times (time between 2 FAD associations) revealed that single exponential models fit the data for all 3 species (characteristic timescales of 1.3, 5, and 2.7 d for yellowfin, skipjack, and bigeye, respectively), with a time-dependent sigmoidal component at short timescales for skipjack and bigeye tuna, ascribed to diel behavior and the short inter-FAD distances of the array. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies but also reveal common behavioral patterns among species and suggest that inter-FAD distances affect absence times but not residence times. In other words, high densities of FADs tend to decrease the amount of time tuna spend unassociated with FADs.",NA,APR 27,2017,103354meps12101,NA,NA,NA

The first study was conducted to identify an effective audio cue. Audio (784 Hz tone) and shock (600 V, 250 mW) stimuli were delivered by remote control to GPS collars on five heifers to prevent access to an exclusion zone surrounding a feed trough. An audio cue was administered when the animal entered the exclusion zone, followed by a shock if the animal continued to proceed. There was an increase in the proportion of heifers responding favourably to the audio Cue by turning, backing up or stopping in sessions 3 and 4 (73%) compared with sessions I and 2 (44%). This indicated that cattle associated the audio cue with the electric shock and learnt to avoid the trough. The main study examined whether cattle location can be controlled by an audio conditioned stimulus without the presence of a visual cue. Weeks I and 2 tested heifers' learning of the association between an audio conditioned stimulus and an electric shock reinforcer. In week 3, the effect of dispensing with the conditioned stimulus was tested. Heifers were allocated to two treatments (n = 11). Treatment 1 received an audio cue and an electric shock on exclusion zone entry, as in the first 2 weeks. Treatment 2 received no audio cue and only an electric shock on exclusion zone entry. There was a difference in the behaviours shown in response to both the audio and shock stimuli between weeks 1 and 2. with more heifers turning in response to the audio cue in week 2 than in week 1. When the virtual fence was moved in week 2, 80% of animals ignored the first audio cue, but the proportion failing to respond to the second audio dropped to 46%, indicating that animals had learnt to avoid the electric shock by responding to the audio cue alone to remain within the virtual fence boundary. In week 3, heifers received significantly fewer shocks when a conditioned stimulus was used. There were no differences between treatments in scores for effectiveness of the fence. appropriateness of the stimulus and adverse responses. This study demonstrates that the appropriate use of an audio cue is an effective conditioned stimulus for virtual fencing of cattle. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The symptoms of 1080 poisoning in dogs appear extremely distressing to observers as manic running, yelping and convulsing are readily interpreted as being indicative of pain and distress. Assessment of pain perceived by animals poisoned by 1080 is difficult, as severe CNS disruptions alter behaviour and EEG patterns that may otherwise be useful in such assessments. This study compared three drug agents combined with 1080 to address the possibility of pain and distress that may be experienced by foxes during 1080 toxicosis. A mixed-sex group of 15 foxes was used in the trial of each of the three drugs: an analgesic (carprofen; 10 mg kg(-1)), an anxiolytic/sedative (diazepam; 10 mg kg(-1)) or an analgesic/sedative (clonidine; 0.75 mg kg(-1)). Each group of 15 foxes was randomly allocated between three treatments of either 0.5 mg kg(-1) of 1080, 0.5 mg kg(-1) of 1080 and a dose of the trial drug, and a dose of the trial drug alone. A telemetry collar was used on each fox to monitor the duration and intensity of activity, and behaviour from dosage to death was recorded using daylight/infra-red video cameras. In foxes dosed with 1080 alone, a mean of 4.05 (+/- 0.86, P < 0.05) h was observed from dosage to symptoms and 1.57 (+/- 0.46, P < 0.05) h from symptoms to death. Diazepam reduced the overall intensity of activity from dosage to death (P < 0.002) and from first symptoms to death (P < 0.05). Diazepam also extended the time until death (P < 0.01) and time taken from dosage to first symptoms (P < 0.01). In the dosages used, clonidine was not as effective as diazepam in reducing activity associated with symptoms of poisoning, although it prolonged the time taken from dosing to first symptoms (P < 0.05). Carprofen did not significantly alter the progression of 1080 toxicosis or the intensity of activity of foxes compared with the group that received 1080 alone. The initial symptoms of 1080 toxicosis include retching and manic running and foxes may be more capable of suffering at this stage than after collapse, where behaviour is likely to be associated with CNS disruption. Diazepam may be effective in minimising any anxiety experienced by foxes especially during the first symptoms of 1080 toxicosis.",C S I R O PUBLISHING,NA,2000,101071WR99022,"Victorian Inst Anim Sci, Vertebrate Pest Res Dept, Frankston, Vic 3199, Australia./Univ Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.","Marks, CA (reprint author), Victorian Inst Anim Sci, Vertebrate Pest Res Dept, POB 48, Frankston, Vic 3199, Australia.",10_1071_WR99022

Expert performance thus implies certain interactive abilities, which critically depend on perceptual coupling. To illustrate this assertion, we examined the coordination dynamics with asymmetric interaction of dyads performing a sports-related cyclical movement task. In pairs, basketball players performed lateral defensive slides in in-phase, until a cue prompted them to switch to antiphase coordination. We assessed how these switches were mediated by phase adaptations of each agent under bidirectional (i.e., agents facing one another) and unidirectional (i.e., one agent facing the back of the other) visual interaction conditions. This imposed asymmetry in visual coupling exemplified an imbalance in the interaction (or 'interact-ability') between two agents. The results concurred the asymmetric coupling: during the switch the agent facing the other adapted his phasing more than the other agent. Furthermore, also in the bidirectional condition the coupling revealed dyad-intrinsic asymmetries (e.g., related to implicit follower-leader strategies). Together, this illustrates that interpersonal coordination is characterized by asymmetric coupling between the agents, and highlights how mutual perception of pertinent information mediates interpersonal coordination. This study offered a first step towards analyzing interpersonal coordination dynamics in relation to 'interact-ability'. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The current investigation examined the right and left leg control differences interlateral asymmetries during static single leg stance and dynamic goal directed kicking with an emphasis of the asymmetrical stabilization and mobilization components of movements. Ten young, healthy, right-leg preferred individuals with minimal kicking experience completed both tests on each limb. During static single leg stance, participants were requested to stand as still as possible with one leg in contact with a force platform. Interlateral asymmetries of the standing leg were quantified using postural variability measures of the center of pressure (COP) standard deviation in the anterior-posterior (SD-COPAP.) and medial-lateral (SD-COPML) directions, resultant COP length and velocity, and 95% COP elliptical area. During dynamic goal directed kicking, participants stood on two adjacent force platforms in a side-by-side foot position and kicked a soccer"" ball toward three different directions as soon as they received an auditory cue of kicking. Three targets were located -degrees 30, 0 degrees or 30 degrees in front and 3.05 m away from the participants' midline. Participants kicked the ball toward the targets with each of their feet. The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) of the kicking leg was used to define the preparation (from above two standard deviations of vGRF baseline to toe-off) and swing (from toe-off to toe-return) phases of dynamic kicking. To determine the presence of interlateral asymmetries during dynamic kicking, the magnitude and timing of the anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) during the preparation phase of kicking were quantified using the lateral net COP (COPnet-ML) time series derived from both force platforms. Postural variability measures of the support leg and the kinematic joint range of motion (JROM) trajectories of the kicking leg were also used to examined interlateral asymmetries. During static stance, no between-leg significance was identified for all dependent measures of COP variability suggesting symmetrical stabilization. During the preparation phase of kicking, both right and left leg kicking exhibited a similar level of APA magnitude, although the left leg kicking was shown to reach its maximum APA magnitude earlier than the right leg. In the support leg role, the right leg showed greater COP variability in the ML direction as compared to the left support leg and greater COP variability was observed when kicking in the ipsilateral direction compared to the center and contralateral directions. For mobilization control, the left kicking leg showed greater JROM displacements at the distal (knee and ankle) joints and reduced JROM primarily with hip frontal plane movements compared to the right kicking leg. The reported interlateral asymmetries during kicking may reflect a behavioral adaptation that results in differential stabilization between the right and left legs. Overall, the findings suggest that novel tasks, such as dynamic goal directed kicking, appear to be more sensitive than static balance in identifying interlateral asymmetries.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AUG,2017,101016jhumov201705004,"[King, Adam C.] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA./[Wang, Zheng] Univ Kansas, Schiefelbusch Inst Life Span Studies, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA./[Wang, Zheng] Univ Kansas, Clin Child Psychol Program, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA./[Wang, Zheng] Univ Kansas, Sch Med, K CART, Overland Pk, KS 66213 USA.","King, AC (reprint author), Texas Christian Univ, TCU Box 297730,2800 S Univ Dr, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",NA

Researchers have argued that listeners are more sensitive to approaching sounds compared with receding sounds, reflecting an evolutionary pressure. However, these studies only manipulated overall sound intensity; therefore, it is unclearwhether looming bias is truly a perceptual bias for changes in source distance, or only in sound intensity. Here we demonstrate both behavioral and neural correlates of looming bias without manipulating overall sound intensity. In natural environments, the pinnae induce spectral cues that give rise to a sense of externalization; when spectral cues are unnatural, sounds are perceived as closer to the listener. We manipulated the contrast of individually tailored spectral cues to create sounds of similar intensity but different naturalness. We confirmed that soundswere perceived as approaching when spectral contrast decreased, and perceived as receding when spectral contrast increased. We measured behavior and electroencephalography while listeners judged motion direction. Behavioral responses showed a looming bias in that responses were more consistent for sounds perceived as approaching than for sounds perceived as receding. In a control experiment, looming bias disappeared when spectral contrast changes were discontinuous, suggesting that perceived motion in distance and not distance itself was driving the bias. Neurally, looming bias was reflected in an asymmetry of late event-related potentials associated with motion evaluation. Hence, both our behavioral and neural findings support a generalization of the auditory looming bias, representing a perceptual preference for approaching auditory objects.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,SEP 5,2017,101073pnas1703247114,"[Baumgartner, Robert; Best, Virginia; Colburn, H.

Here we examine the contribution of male aggression to this competitive asymmetry by measuring aggressive responses to mounts. We presented male mounts of the two parental species to Townsend's and hermit warblers outside the zone and to hybrids within the zone. Outside the zone, Townsend's males are more aggressive to both conspecific and heterospecific mounts than are hermit males. This asymmetry should move the zone in the direction inferred from previous studies. Hybrids fall between parentals in their aggressiveness, which should accelerate the movement of the zone. Remarkably, we found no relationship between phenotype and aggression in individual males at a locality within the hybrid zone. The forces of selection and dispersal that maintain narrow hybrid zones should generate such a correlation if aggressive differences between the parental species are genetically controlled. We resolve this conflict by proposing a behavioral model of competitive sorting within localities. If birds are sorted across the hybrid zone according to competitive abilities, and competitive interactions within neighborhoods are more or less complete, then the correlation between phenotype and aggression within any given neighborhood will be eliminated. We tested this model by examining the relationship between phenotype and aggression across the zone. Warblers in hybrid neighbor-hoods on the Townsend's side of the zone are more aggressive than warblers in hybrid neighborhoods on the hermit side, indicating that competitive sorting is occurring.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JAN-FEB,2000,101093beheco11193,"Univ Washington, Coll Forest Resources, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./Univ Washington, Burke Museum, Seattle, WA 98195 USA./Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","Pearson, SF (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, POB 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",NA

However, animal orientation in a flow has yet to be satisfactorily explained because it is difficult to directly measure animal heading and flow. We constructed a new animal movement model based on the asymmetric distribution of the GPS (Global Positioning System) track vector along its mean vector, which might be caused by wind flow. This statistical model enabled us to simultaneously estimate animal heading (navigational decision-making) and ocean wind information over the range traversed by free-ranging birds. We applied this method to the tracking data of homing seabirds. The wind flow estimated by the model was consistent with the spatiotemporally coarse wind information provided by an atmospheric simulation model. The estimated heading information revealed that homing seabirds could head in a direction different from that leading to the colony to offset wind effects and to enable them to eventually move in the direction they intended to take, even though they are over the open sea where visual cues are unavailable. Our results highlight the utility of combining large data sets of animal movements with the ""inverse problem approach,"" enabling unobservable causal factors to be estimated from the observed output data.

Analyses were conducted at both the individual and population level to assess whether inter-annual variation in habitat use (2014, 2015, and 2017) could be explained by dynamic oceanographic features, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentrations, or by static bathymetric features. At both scales of analyses, the foraging behaviour of Cassin's auklets was most strongly influenced by SST. At the individual level, birds spent more time foraging in areas with lower SST, relative to other areas visited over the course of a foraging trip. At the population level, the at-sea distribution of Cassin's auklets varied across years, with birds using areas northwest of colony in 2014 and areas west of the colony in 2015 and 2017. Furthermore, the probability of foraging across the study area was higher in areas with lower SST, suggesting that SST influences the broad-scale foraging distribution of Cassin's auklets.

We estimate the seasonal abundance of North Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) from a 3-year aerial survey conducted with commercial spotter pilots, while also utilizing findings from analyses of tracking and tagging data. We apply statistical correction and calibration to seasonal abundance estimates accounting for measured changes in horizontal and vertical movement behaviour, size, shape and aggregation of bluefin tuna schools. Our approach relies on ecological knowledge of bluefin tuna to extrapolate survey observations across areas not sampled by correcting survey abundance estimates based on range of movement search pattern and depth preference. We demonstrate how separate findings obtained through the analysis of data collected across different spatial and temporal scales can be integrated to correct and calibrate estimates of population abundance. We obtain fitted estimates of seasonal abundance of bluefin tuna in the GOM during 1994-1996 in the range of 45,000-51,000 individuals. If tuna behaviour is not accounted for, we estimate that the base or residual survey precision would be 4-7% determined from analysis of recent spotter survey data in the study region. We estimate the precision in estimating seasonal abundance accounting for tuna behaviour to lie within a range of 1,301-3,302%. Under hypothetical future improvements in survey design that achieve a precision of 20% in transect length and placement, we calculate net-precision to lie within a range of 82-93%. This calculation assumes reducible uncertainty in school size estimation and irreducible uncertainty in movement and school-aggregation behaviour.

Dolphins were also observed entering the Bandiala and Djinack channels, and travelling across the border into Gambia. The initial sighting locations were 0.043-1.192 km from shore, and tracked dolphins did not move more than 2.082 km from shore. Groups comprised 1-29 animals (mean 9.3 animals), and at least three neonate calves were observed during November. The overall relative abundance was 0.018 sight. km(-1) and 0.175 ind. km(-1). Sightings were concentrated in the Diomboss where relative abundance reached 0.037 sight. km(-1) and 0.331 ind. km(-1). Non-intensive photo-identification produced a minimum population size of 103 animals, the highest recorded for S. teuszii anywhere in its range. Photo-identification also confirmed a movement of individuals between different parts of the Saloum Delta. Combined travel-forage dominated the behaviour.

Continued research priorities include long-term population monitoring, identifying the species' spawning and nursery grounds, and determining its use of estuaries and marine coastal waters. Although recent and ongoing research is filling in knowledge gaps, the Atlantic Sturgeon's life history and its severely depleted populations make this a challenging species to fully characterize. Our goal was to compile data collected over 7 years from fish captured in the Penobscot River estuary, Maine, to inform management decision making. Atlantic Sturgeon were captured (n = 199), recaptured (n = 16), and passively telemetered (n = 32 that were analyzed here) from 2006 to 2013. Captured individuals were predominantly subadults, and data from telemetry indicated repeated use of a 5-km reach of the mesohaline portion of the estuary. Subadults predictably emigrated from the river each fall (mean date +/- SD, August 31 +/- 43.5 d) and immigrated back each spring to early summer (May 15 +/- 27.8 d), with most individuals (>95% [31 of 32]) returning one or more years after tagging. Marine detections of these subadults were common (81.25% [26 of 32]) and spanned the geographic extent of both the threatened and endangered U.S. distinct population segments and into international waters, e.g., from the Hudson River, New York, to Minas Basin, Nova Scotia. However, they were more typically detected by receivers in the Gulf of Maine; 77% (20 of 26) were only detected in the Gulf of Maine when not in the river. These data indicate that, based on the temporal and spatial predictability of habitat use, the estuary of the Penobscot River is important for subadult Atlantic Sturgeon of the Gulf of Maine.

In this review, we first introduce the most relevant microscale, mesoscale and synoptic scale atmospheric phenomena from the point of view of a migrating bird. We then provide an overview of the individual responses of migrant birds (when, where and how to fly) in relation to these phenomena. We explore the cumulative impact of individual responses to weather during migration, and the consequences thereof for populations and migratory systems. In general, individual birds seem to have a much more flexible response to weather than previously thought, but we also note similarities in migratory behaviour across taxa.

However, the mechanisms that enable nocturnal migrants to cross large bodies of water successfully remain unclear. In the north of the Netherlands, autumn migration of birds occurs mainly along a southwesterly axis and can be predicted very successfully. However, on rare occasions, intense and unexpected migration events occur with a significantly different track direction. We hypothesized that these events represent birds arriving from Norway and other Scandinavian countries after crossing the North Sea barrier. We implemented a back-trajectory model calibrated with radar data from autumn 2006-2008 to test our hypothesis, assuming that birds maintain a constant heading and airspeed during flight. A total of 14 events were identified. In some cases measured mean ground speeds were twice as high as mean airspeeds. Model results demonstrated that birds took advantage of atmospheric conditions to cross the North Sea quickly. In the majority of cases, birds could be tracked to Norway, Denmark or Sweden when maintaining a constant airspeed and heading en route, but not in all cases. Thus migrants must be flexible in their reaction to wind to take advantage of dynamic and heterogeneous atmospheric conditions experienced en route. The integration of measurements with simulation modelling provides a powerful framework to improve our understanding of how animals move through a dynamic environment and the consequences of their behaviour.

Western Australia","Context Studying interactions between a wildlife species and its spatial environment can enable a deeper understanding of its ecology. Studies of spatial ecology are generally undertaken by attaching tracking devices to selected individuals and following their movements. Highly mobile species, such as black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus spp.), that occupy habitats with patchy resources are ideal candidates. The powerful beak and chewing habits of black cockatoos make it difficult to successfully attach tracking devices to them.
Aims We developed a safe technique for attaching tracking devices to black cockatoos and assessed the impact of the tracking devices, as well as their performance in relation to battery life, retention time and accuracy of location fixes.
Methods We describe a technique for attaching Telonics (Mesa, AZ, USA) Argos Avian Transmitter TAV 2617 tracking devices to the two central tail feathers of black cockatoos.
Key results Of 26 tracking devices fitted (24 to Carnaby's cockatoos, C. latirostris; two to Baudin's cockatoos, C. baudinii), 20 exhibited longer retention time than the nominal battery life. One tracking device was chewed until it was non-functional before release and two were presumed chewed after release because their tracking devices failed prematurely. There was no evidence that the tracking devices inhibited the flight capability of cockatoos. The performance of the Argos tracking devices exceeded expectations with regard to retention times, battery life and overall accuracy of location fixes. The tracking devices enabled detection of instances of rapid long-distance movements, including one bird that travelled 70km between night roosts while migrating. Most study birds (68%) remained within 50km of their release sites while monitored.
Conclusion The tracking devices were a suitable choice for black cockatoos and for the purpose of this study. They posed minimal snag risk, were of suitable dimensions for tail attachment and they enabled data to be collected even if birds dispersed long distances. The main limitations that must be considered when assessing their suitability for future research projects are the errors associated with location fixes, limited retention time in relation to moulting of tail feathers and limited battery life.
Implications The development of a method for successfully attaching tracking devices to black cockatoos opens the possibility to study aspects of the ecology of black cockatoos and other highly mobile species that was not previously possible.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2014,101071WR14138,"[Groom, Christine] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[Groom, Christine; Dawson, Rick] Bentley Delivery Ctr, Dept Parks & Wildlife, Bentley, WA 6983, Australia./[Warren, Kris; Le Souef, Anna] Murdoch Univ, Coll Vet Med, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia./[Groom, Christine; Le Souef, Anna] Perth Zoo, S Perth, WA 6151, Australia.","Groom, C (reprint author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol M092, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",10_1071_WR14138

Recent evidence has suggested an increased rate of comorbid ADHD and subclinical attentional impairments in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. However, little is known regarding the underlying neural mechanisms of attentional functions in BN.
Method
Twenty BN patients and twenty age-and weight-matched healthy controls (HC) were investigated using a modified version of the Attention Network Task (ANT) in an fMRI study. This design enabled an investigation of the neural mechanisms associated with the three attention networks involved in alerting, reorienting and executive attention.
Results
The BN patients showed hyperactivation in parieto-occipital regions and reduced deactivation of default-mode-network (DMN) areas during alerting compared with HCs. Posterior cingulate activation during alerting correlated with the severity of eating-disorder symptoms within the patient group. Conversely, BN patients showed hypoactivation during reorienting and executive attention in anterior cingulate regions, the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)and parahippocampus compared with HCs, which was negatively associated with global ADHD symptoms and impulsivity, respectively.
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate altered brain mechanisms in BN associated with all three attentional networks. Failure to deactivate the DMN and increased parieto-occipital activation required for alerting might be associated with a constant preoccupation with food or body image-related thoughts. Hypoactivation of executive control networks and TPJ might increase the likelihood of inattentive and impulsive behaviors and poor emotion regulation. Thus, dysfunction in the attentional network in BN goes beyond an altered executive attentional domain and needs to be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of BN.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SEP 8,2016,101371journalpone0161329,"[Seitz, Jochen; Hueck, Manuel; Dahmen, Brigitte; Schulte-Ruether, Martin; Herpertz-Dahlmann, Beate; Konrad, Kerstin] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Univ Hosp, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychotherapy &, Aachen, Germany./[Seitz, Jochen] Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Maastricht, Netherlands./[Schulte-Ruether, Martin] JARA BRAIN, D-52074 Aachen, Germany./[Legenbauer, Tanja] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Univ Hosp Hamm, LWL Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Hamm, Germany./[Legenbauer, Tanja] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Psychiat Outpatient Clin, Mainz, Germany.","Seitz, J (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Univ Hosp, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychotherapy &, Aachen, Germany.; Seitz, J (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Cognit Neurosci, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Maastricht, Netherlands.",10_1371_journal_pone_0161329

Although studies have identified a ventral frontoparietal network underlying attention [1, 2], little is known about whether and how early visual areas are involved in involuntary [3, 4] and even less in voluntary [5] reorienting, and their temporal dynamics are unknown. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occipital cortex to interfere with attentional reorienting and study its role and temporal dynamics in this process. Human observers performed an orientation discrimination task, with either valid or invalid attention cueing, across a range of stimulus contrasts. Valid cueing induced a behavioral response gain increase, higher asymptotic performance for attended than unattended locations. During subsequent TMS sessions, observers performed the same task, with high stimulus contrast. Based on phosphene mapping, TMS double pulses were applied at one of various delays to a consistent brain location in retinotopic areas (V1/V2), corresponding to the evoked signal of the target or distractor, in a valid or invalid trial. Thus, the stimulation was identical for the four experimental conditions (valid/invalid cue condition x target/distractor-stimulated). TMS modulation of the target and distractor were both periodic (5 Hz, theta) and out of phase with respect to each other in invalid trials only, when attention had to be disengaged from the distractor and reoriented to the target location. Reorientation of voluntary attention periodically involves V1/V2 at the theta frequency. These results suggest that TMS probes theta phase-reset by attentional reorienting and help link periodic sampling in time and attention reorienting in space.",CELL PRESS,JUN 20,2016,101016jcub201604046,"[Dugue, Laura; Roberts, Marie; Carrasco, Marisa] NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA./[Dugue, Laura; Carrasco, Marisa] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.","Dugue, L (reprint author), NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA.; Dugue, L (reprint author), NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",NA

Reintroduced predators, for example, may create unanticipated competition scenarios that influence local carnivore guilds. Here, we tested whether newly released Mexican gray wolves in Chihuahua, Mexico interacted with resident pumas, as a first step in exploring potential competition between the two species. We employed GPS data and novel methods offered by MoveMine 2.0 to quantify attraction-repulsion between individual wolves and pumas during two time periods: the first when wolves were free roaming, and the second when they restricted their movements to an area around their den and rendezvous site to protect and provide for pups. In summary, attraction-repulsion analyses conducted with MoveMine provided meaningful outputs, but we would highlight the importance of fieldwork to interpret interactions and significance values calculated between pairs. We found that high attraction values resulted from mutual attraction between wolves in the same pack, between wolves and one puma they repeatedly harassed, as well as between two pumas that repeatedly exhibited social tolerance for each other. Thus, the analyses offered by MoveMine provided a powerful means of identifying interactions and assessing attraction-repulsion relevant to questions of intra- and interspecific competition, but required intimate knowledge of the species studied and the interactions between them to interpret outputs correctly.

Baum, JK
Backwell, PRY",ANIM BEHAV,SEXUAL SELECTION; CHOICE,NA,"Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca musica, sometimes build sand hoods at the entrances of their burrows to which they attract females for mating. On average, females visit 17 males in as many minutes before they choose a mate, and they preferentially visit males with hoods. When moving between burrows, fiddler crabs of both sexes sometimes approach and temporarily hide against objects on the surface. Hence, mate-searching females may approach hoods because they resemble (mimic) other objects that crabs approach to reduce their predation risk. We conducted two experiments to test this sensory trap hypothesis. First, we determined whether sexually receptive and nonreceptive female U. musica and nonreceptive female U. stenodactylus, a species that does not build structures, spontaneously approach hoods (replicas), stones, pieces of wood and shells. As predicted by the sensory trap hypothesis, both species, irrespective of sexual receptivity, approached these objects and neither preferred hoods. Second, to determine whether female U. musica show a preference for hoods when they search for a mate, we recorded the frequency with which females approached males with natural hoods, hood replicas, wood, stones and shells. Again as expected, females approached males with these different structures at the same rates. We conclude that hoods are effective mimics of objects that females approach for safety whether they are searching for a mate or not. Males benefit by using this sensory trap because hoods make them more attractive, and receptive females may benefit when they approach hoods because they reduce their mate-search risk.

As a result, non-human primates often adjust their social decision-making strategies depending on the audience composition at a given time. Here we sought to test how the unique vocal behaviour of multiple audience members affected decisions to communicate. To address this issue, we developed a novel experimental paradigm in which common marmosets directly interacted with multiple 'virtual monkeys' (VMs), each of whom represented an individual marmoset with distinct vocal behaviour. This active social signalling paradigm provided subjects an opportunity to interact with and learn about the behaviour of each VM in the network and apply this knowledge in subsequent communicative decisions. We found that subjects' propensity to interact with particular VMs was determined by the behaviour of each VM in the audience and suggests that marmoset social decision-making strategies are highly adaptive to nuances of the immediate communication network.",ROYAL SOC,JAN 1,2017,101098rsbl20160934,"[Toarmino, Camille R.; Miller, Cory T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA./[Toarmino, Camille R.; Wong, Lauren; Miller, Cory T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Cort Syst & Behav Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA./[Miller, Cory T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Neurosci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","Toarmino, CR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Toarmino, CR (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Cort Syst & Behav Lab, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",5310588

Animals were trained using food as a reward in an operant reinforcement paradigm. Stimuli were 1-s sinusoids with 10-ms rise/fall times delivered through insert earphones (Etymotic ER-1) having expandable foam eartips. The animals generally produced threshold contours similar in shape to those reported for other macaques species, except that the low-frequency thresholds may have been slightly higher in the present studies. At middle and high frequencies, thresholds fell at the lower extreme of the range previously reported in other macaque species. The possible difference in low-frequency thresholds may have been a result of either transducer and calibration differences between studies or true species variations, or both. Though somewhat limited at high frequencies, the insert earphones used in these studies offer more reliable calibrations, less susceptibility to changes in positioning with movement of the animal, and greater interaural attenuation.

Waterbirds, unlike most aquatic organisms, can move between catchments, exploiting habitat wherever it occurs. In Australia, patterns of resource availability for waterbirds are mostly pulsed with peaks of productivity, coinciding with flooding and differing in time and space, affecting individuals, species and functional groups of waterbirds. Australian waterbirds are no different from waterbirds elsewhere, with their behaviour reflecting broad-scale resource availability. They respond to changing patterns of resource distribution, with rapid movements at spatial and temporal scales commensurate with the dynamics of the resource. The most serious conservation threat to waterbirds is a bottleneck in resource availability, leading to population declines, increasingly forced by anthropogenic impacts. River regulation and other threats (e. g. draining) reduce the availability of wetland habitat and decrease the probability of viable resource patches. It is axiomatic that waterbirds need water and such population bottlenecks may occur when the availability of water across the continent is limited. The rehabilitation of regulated rivers with environmental flows and protection of naturally flowing rivers in the arid region are essential for long-term sustainability of Australia's waterbird populations.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2010,101071MF09088,"[Kingsford, R.

Their biomass is large and their burrowing and ingestion of soils alters soil physicochemical properties. Because of their large biomass, earthworms are regarded as an indicator of ""soil heath''. However, primarily because the difficulties in quantifying their behavior, the extent of their impact on soil material flow dynamics and soil health is poorly understood. Image data, with the aid of image processing tools, are a powerful tool in quantifying the movements of objects. Image data sets are often very large and time-consuming to analyze, especially when continuously recorded and manually processed. We aimed to develop a system to quantify earthworm movement from video recordings. Our newly developed program successfully tracked the two-dimensional positions of three separate parts of the earthworm and simultaneously output the change in its body length. From the output data, we calculated the velocity of the earthworm's movement. Our program processed the image data three times faster than the manual tracking system. To date, there are no existing systems to quantify earthworm activity from continuously recorded image data. The system developed in this study will reduce input time by a factor of three compared with manual data entry and will reduce errors involved in quantifying large data sets. Furthermore, it will provide more reliable measured values, although the program is still a prototype that needs further testing and improvement. Combined with other techniques, such as measuring metabolic gas emissions from earthworm bodies, this program could provide continuous observations of earthworm behavior in response to environmental variables under laboratory conditions.

We examined whether measures of acceleration of calves in a large enclosure could detect effects on play running of age, dehorning and weaning off milk. Holstein calves were placed in an arena for 15 min and their running, jumping/kicking and walking were recorded from video. Accelerometers were attached to one hind leg and the summed acceleration was recorded. In Exp. 1, 24 calves were placed in the arena the days before and after being dehorned on d4 of age with caustic paste and sedation or as control calves. Prior to and after dehorning, there was a strong positive correlation between the duration of running and the total acceleration (r(s) > 0.77: P < 0.001). After dehorning, the dehorned calves had a lower duration of running (median = 19.7 s vs. 29.2 s; P = 0.049) and a smaller total acceleration (P = 0.031) than control calves and the duration of running was positively correlated with total acceleration (r(s) = 0.78; P < 0.001). In Exp. 2, 12 calves were placed in the arena during the week before weaning began and the week after being weaned fully off milk, with weaning completed around 10 weeks of age. Before weaning, the duration of running was positively correlated with total acceleration (r(s) > 0.84: P < 0.001). After weaning, there was a decrease in both the duration of running (median = 14.2 s vs. 47.9 s; P < 0.01) and the total acceleration (P < 0.01), and the change in running duration following weaning was correlated with the change in total acceleration (r(s) = 0.83; P < 0.001). Data combined from the two experiments showed that older calves did more running and had a higher summed acceleration than younger calves (P < 0.001) but tended to walk less (P = 0.09). The summed acceleration was strongly correlated with the duration of running (r(s) = 0.88; P < 0.001) and moderately correlated with the frequency of jumping/kicking (r(s) = 0.44; P = 0.008). Age, dehorning and weaning all affected the amount of running the calves did in the arena, and measures of acceleration could be used to automatically estimate the duration of play running suggesting this was a time-efficient way of detecting the calves' locomotor play.

To accomplish this task, we propose a novel fish body model that uses a chain of rectangles to represent fish body. Then in detection stage, the point of maximum curvature along fish boundary is detected and set as fish nose point. Afterwards, in tracking stage, we firstly apply Kalman filter to track fish head, then use rectangle chain fitting to fit fish body, which at the same time further judge the head tracking results and remove the incorrect ones.

Thorough documentation of social interactions is crucial to study the causes and consequences of sociality in gregarious animals. Wireless digital transceivers represent a promising tool to revolutionize data collection for the study of social interactions in terms of the degree of automation, data quantity, and quality. Unfortunately, devices for automated proximity sensing via direct communication among animal-borne sensors are usually heavy and do not allow for the investigation of small animal species, which represent the majority of avian and mammalian taxa. We present a lightweight animal-borne sensor node that is built from commercially available components and uses a sophisticated scheme for energy-efficient communication, with high sampling rates at relatively low power consumption. We demonstrate the basic functionality of the sensor node under laboratory conditions and its applicability for the study of social interactions among free-ranging animals. The first field tests were performed on two species of bats in temperate and tropical ecosystems. At <2g, this sensor node is light enough to observe a broad spectrum of taxa including small vertebrates. Given our specifications, the system was especially sensitive to changes in distance within the short range (up to a distance of 4m between tags). High spatial resolution at short distances enables the evaluation of interactions among individuals at a fine scale and the investigation of close contacts. This technology opens new avenues of research, allowing detailed investigation of events associated with social contact, such as mating behavior, pathogen transmission, social learning, and resource sharing. Social behavior that is not easily observed becomes observable, for example, in animals living in burrows or in nocturnal animals. A switch from traditional methods to the application of digital transceiver chips in proximity sensing offers numerous advantages in addition to an enormous increase in data quality and quantity. For future applications, the platform allows for the integration of additional sensors that may collect physiological or environmental data. Such information complements social network studies and may allow for a deeper understanding of animal ecology and social behavior.",WILEY,APR,2016,101002ece32040,"[Ripperger, Simon; Josic, Darija; Mayer, Frieder] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany./[Hierold, Martin; Koelpin, Alexander; Weigel, Robert] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Elect Engn, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany./[Hartmann, Markus] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Informat Technol Commun Elect, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany./[Page, Rachel] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado 0843-03092, Balboa, Ancon, Panama./[Mayer, Frieder] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res, Berlin, Germany.","Ripperger, S (reprint author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",NA
"Automated telemetry reveals age specific differences in flight duration

costs; Groundspeed; Migration; Songbirds; Tailwinds; Wind support","Background: Given that winds encountered on migration could theoretically double or half the energy expenditure of aerial migrants, there should be strong selection on behaviour in relation to wind conditions aloft. However, evidence suggests that juvenile songbirds are less choosy about wind conditions at departure relative to adults, potentially increasing energy expenditure during flight. To date, there has yet to be a direct comparison of flight efficiency between free-living adult and juvenile songbirds during migration in relation to wind conditions aloft, likely because of the challenges of following known aged individual songbirds during flight. We used an automated digital telemetry array to compare the flight efficiency of adult and juvenile Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) as they flew nearly 100 km during two successive stages of their fall migration; a departure flight from their breeding grounds out over the ocean and then a migratory flight along a coast. Using a multilevel path modelling framework, we evaluated the effects of age, flight stage, tailwind component, and crosswind component on flight duration and groundspeed.
Results: We found that juveniles departed under wind conditions that were less supportive relative to adults and that this resulted in juveniles taking 1.4 times longer to complete the same flight trajectories as adults. We did not find an effect of age on flight duration or groundspeed after controlling for wind conditions aloft, suggesting that both age groups were flying at similar airspeeds. We also found that groundspeeds were 1.7 times faster along the coast than over the ocean given more favourable tailwinds along the coast and because birds appeared to be climbing in altitude over the ocean, diverting some energy from horizontal to vertical movement.
Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence that adult songbirds have considerably more efficient migratory flights than juveniles, and that this efficiency is driven by the selection of more supportive tailwind conditions aloft. We suggest that the tendency for juveniles to be less choosy about wind conditions at departure relative to adults could be adaptive if the benefits of having a more flexible departure schedule exceed the time and energy savings realized during flight with more supportive winds.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,NA,2015,101186s4046201500465,"[Mitchell, Greg W.; Woodworth, Bradley K.; Norris, D.

Many migrants are in steep decline, and understanding their behavior within and among migrations is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies across the full annual cycle. One of the most rapidly declining songbirds in North America is the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus; 85-95% decline over the past 50 yr), and stopover ecology is a major gap in our knowledge of its annual cycle. We utilized an automated telemetry array in western Lake Erie and the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to track landscape-scale movements, stopover duration, departure behavior, and between-season site fidelity in this species. We found that stopover duration during both fall and spring was nearly 1 mo (mean=25.5 days)-exceptionally long for a passerine. During spring, birds in both poor condition and high degree of molt had longer stopovers, post-departure flights were relatively long for a songbird, and tailwinds predicted departure in both seasons. Many individuals made landscape-scale (10-35 km) relocations during stopover. Site fidelity was high for a passerine, in terms of both route and stopover site. Taken together, these behaviors describe a migration strategy that largely matches the staging behavior of shorebirds. Lastly, we found that Rusty Blackbirds migrate directly across Lake Erie and migrate primarily at night, which might expose them to mortality from offshore wind development. Collectively, our results indicate that high-quality stopover habitat may be critically important to Rusty Blackbird populations. More broadly, our results highlight the need to expand the scale of stopover studies, and to further explore all aspects of species' annual cycles to understand potential limiting factors on populations.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JUL,2018,101642AUK172191,"[Wright, James R.; Tonra, Christopher M.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA./[Powell, Luke L.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Natl Zool Pk, Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC USA./[Powell, Luke L.] Univ Durham, Dept Biosci, Durham, England.","Wright, JR (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",NA

Continuous observation of livestock by farm staff is impractical in a commercial setting to the degree required to detect behavioural changes relevant for early intervention. An automated monitoring system is developed; it automatically tracks pig movement with depth video cameras, and automatically measures standing, feeding, drinking, and locomotor activities from 3D trajectories. Predictions of standing, feeding, and drinking were validated, but not locomotor activities. An artificial, disruptive challenge; i.e., introduction of a novel object, is used to cause reproducible behavioural changes to enable development of a system to detect the changes automatically. Validation of the automated monitoring system with the controlled challenge study provides a reproducible framework for further development of robust early warning systems for pigs. The automated system is practical in commercial settings because it provides continuous monitoring of multiple behaviours, with metrics of behaviours that may be considered more intuitive and have diagnostic validity. The method has the potential to transform how livestock are monitored, directly impact their health and welfare, and address issues in livestock farming, such as antimicrobial use.",NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,DEC 14,2017,101038s41598017174516,"[Matthews, Stephen G.; Plotz, Thomas] Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Open Lab, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England./[Miller, Amy L.; Kyriazakis, Ilias] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Agr, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England./[Matthews, Stephen G.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Interdisciplinary Comp & Complex BioSyst ICOS Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England./[Plotz, Thomas] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Atlanta, GA 30318 USA.","Matthews, SG (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Open Lab, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.; Matthews, SG (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Interdisciplinary Comp & Complex BioSyst ICOS Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",10_1038_s41598_017_17451_6

In the speech synthesis community, interest in improving the expressive quality of synthetic speech has grown considerably. While the focus has been on the linguistic aspects, such as precise control of speech intonation to achieve desired expressiveness, inclusion of nonlinguistic cues could further enhance the expressive quality of synthetic speech. Laughter is one such cue used for communicating, say, a happy or amusing context. It can be generated in many varieties and qualities: from a short exhalation to a long full-blown episode. Laughter is modeled at two levels, the overall episode level and at the local call level. The first attempts to capture the overall temporal behavior in a parametric model based on the equations that govern the simple harmonic motion of a mass-spring system is presented. By changing a set of easily available parameters, the authors are able to synthesize a variety of laughter. At the call level, the authors relied on a standard linear prediction based analysis-synthesis model. Results of subjective tests to assess the acceptability and naturalness of the synthetic laughter relative to real human laughter samples are presented.

Automatic continuous monitoring can provide quantitative data on each animal's condition and coordination ability. The objective of the present work is to develop an automated mouse observation system integrated with a conventional open-field test for motor function evaluation. Data were acquired from 86 mice having a targeted disruption of the arylsulphatase A (ASA) gene and having lowered coordinated locomotion abilities as a symptom. The mice used were 36 heterozygotes (12 females) and 50 knockout mice (30 females) at the age of 6 months. The mice were placed one at a time into the test setup, which consisted of a Plexiglas cage (53 X 34.5 X 26 cm) and two fluorescent bulbs for proper illumination. The transparent cage allowed images to be captured from underneath the cage, so image information could be obtained about the dynamic variation of the positions of the limbs of the mice for gait reconstruction. Every mouse was recorded for 10 min. Background subtraction and color filtering were used to measure and calculate image features, which are variables that contain crucial information, such as the mouse's position, orientation, body outline, and possible locations for the mouse's paws. A set of heuristic rules was used to prune implausible paw features and label the remaining ones as front/hind and left/right. After we had pruned the implausible paw features, the paw features that were consistent over subsequent images were matched to footprints. Finally, from the measured footprint sequence, eight parameters were calculated in order to quantify the gait of the mouse. This automatic observation technique can be integrated with a regular open-field test, where the trajectory and motor function of a free-moving mouse are measured simultaneously.",SPRINGER,AUG,2009,103758BRM413787,"[Berckmans, Daniel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, BIORES M3, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.","Berckmans, D (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, BIORES M3, Kasteelpk Arenberg 30, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",10_3758_BRM_41_3_787

This study proposes and develops an algorithm to automatically classify PA types and in-vehicle status using GPS and accelerometer data.

There is a lack of objective measurement of treatment effects for in-clinic and at-home use that can provide an overview of the treatment response. The objective of this paper was to develop a method for objective quantification of advanced PD motor symptoms related to off episodes and peak dose dyskinesia, using spiral data gathered by a touch screen telemetry device. More specifically, the aim was to objectively characterize motor symptoms (bradykinesia and dyskinesia), to help in automating the process of visual interpretation of movement anomalies in spirals as rated by movement disorder specialists. Digitized upper limb movement data of 65 advanced PD patients and 10 healthy (HE) subjects were recorded as they performed spiral drawing tasks on a touch screen device in their home environment settings. Several spatiotemporal features were extracted from the time series and used as inputs to machine learning methods. The methods were validated against ratings on animated spirals scored by four movement disorder specialists who visually assessed a set of kinematic features and the motor symptom. The ability of the method to discriminate between PD patients and HE subjects and the test-retest reliability of the computed scores were also evaluated. Computed scores correlated well with mean visual ratings of individual kinematic features. The best performing classifier (Multilayer Perceptron) classified the motor symptom (bradykinesia or dyskinesia) with an accuracy of 84% and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 in relation to visual classifications of the raters. In addition, the method provided high discriminating power when distinguishing between PD patients and HE subjects as well as had good test-retest reliability.

Motion-sensor ""camera traps"" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset.

An approximation known as the ""average dispersal success"" provides a tool for converting complex models, which may include stage structure and a mechanistic description of dispersal, into a simple matrix model. This simpler matrix model has two key advantages. First, it is easier to parameterize from the types of empirical data typically available to conservation biologists, such as survivorship, fecundity, and the fraction of juveniles produced in a study area that also recruit within the study area. Second, it is more amenable to theoretical investigation. Here, we use the average dispersal success approximation to develop estimates of the critical reserve size for systems comprising single patches or simple metapopulations. The quantitative approach can be used for both plants and animals; however, to provide a concrete example of the technique's utility, we focus on a special case pertinent to animals. Specifically, for territorial animals, we can characterize such an estimate of minimum viable habitat area in terms of the number of home ranges that the reserve contains. Consequently, the average dispersal success framework provides a framework through which home range size, natal dispersal distances, and metapopulation dynamics can be linked to reserve design. We briefly illustrate the approach using empirical data for the swift fox (Vulpes velox).",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,APR,2006,1018901051076120060160820ADSLHR20CO2,"Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA./Univ Alberta, Dept Math, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada.","Fagan, WF (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",NA

Propulsive forces should also correlate with energy expenditures associated with locomotion-an important cost of foraging. As such, biologging tags containing accelerometers are being used to generate proxies for animal energy expenditures despite being unable to distinguish rotational movements from linear movements. However, recent miniaturizations of gyroscopes offer the possibility of resolving this shortcoming and obtaining better estimates of body accelerations of swimming animals. We derived accelerations using gyroscope data for swimming Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and determined how well the measured accelerations correlated with actual swimming speeds and with theoretical drag. We also compared dive averaged dynamic body acceleration estimates that incorporate gyroscope data, with the widely used Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration (ODBA) metric, which does not use gyroscope data. Four Steller sea lions equipped with biologging tags were trained to swim alongside a boat cruising at steady speeds in the range of 4 to 10 kph. At each speed, and for each dive, we computed a measure called Gyro-Informed Dynamic Acceleration (GIDA) using a method incorporating gyroscope data with accelerometer data. We derived a new metric-Averaged Propulsive Body Acceleration (APBA), which is the average gain in speed per flipper stroke divided by mean stroke cycle duration. Our results show that the gyro-based measure (APBA) is a better predictor of speed than ODBA. We also found that APBA can estimate average thrust production during a single stroke-glide cycle, and can be used to estimate energy expended during swimming. The gyroscope-derived methods we describe should be generally applicable in swimming animals where propulsive accelerations can be clearly identified in the signal-and they should also prove useful for dead-reckoning and improving estimates of energy expenditures from locomotion.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 10,2016,101371journalpone0157326,"[Ware, Colin] Univ New Hampshire, Ctr Coastal & Ocean Mapping, Durham, NH 03824 USA./[Trites, Andrew W.; Rosen, David A.

The herbivorous fly Scaptomyza nigrita (Drosophilidae) is a specialist on a single mustard species, bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia; Brassicaceae) and is in a fly lineage that evolved to feed on mustards only in the past 10-20 million years. In contrast to many mustard specialists, S. nigrita does not prevent formation of toxic breakdown products (mustard oils) arising from glucosinolates (GLS), the primary defensive compounds in mustard plants. Therefore, it is an appealing model for dissecting the early stages of host specialization. Because mustard oils actually form in the bodies of S. nigrita, we hypothesized that in lieu of a specialized detoxification mechanism, S. nigrita may mitigate exposure to high GLS levels within plant tissues using behavioral avoidance. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) treatment increased GLS biosynthesis in bittercress, repelled adult female flies, and reduced larval growth. S. nigrita larval damage also induced foliar GLS, especially in apical leaves, which correspondingly displayed the least S. nigrita damage in controlled feeding trials and field surveys. Paradoxically, flies preferred to feed and oviposit on GLS-producing Arabidopsis thaliana despite larvae performing worse in these plants versus non-GLS-producing mutants. GLS may be feeding cues for S. nigrita despite their deterrent and defensive properties, which underscores the diverse relationship a mustard specialist has with its host when lacking a specialized means of mustard oil detoxification.",WILEY,MAY,2016,101002ece32082,"[Humphrey, Parris T.; Gloss, Andrew D.; Alexandre, Nicolas M.; Villalobos, Martha M.; Groen, Simon C.; Whiteman, Noah K.] Univ Arizona, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA./[Humphrey, Parris T.; Gloss, Andrew D.; Alexandre, Nicolas M.; Villalobos, Martha M.; Fremgen, Marcella R.; Groen, Simon C.; Whiteman, Noah K.] Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Gothic, CO 81224 USA./[Meihls, Lisa N.; Jander, Georg] Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA./[Humphrey, Parris T.] Harvard Univ, Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA./[Whiteman, Noah K.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Meihls, Lisa N.] USDA ARS, Plant Genet Res Unit, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.","Humphrey, PT (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.; Whiteman, NK (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",NA

An elaborated arachnid-like caudal structure is a unique feature of this viper, hence gives it the common name ""Iranian spider-tailed viper"". During tail wagging, the structure is reminiscent of a moving spider. Tail movements are used for two different purposes in snakes: defense via tail vibration and hunting via both caudal luring and caudal distraction. Caudal luring in snakes is the wriggling or wagging of the posterior part of tail, in the presence of a potential prey, with conspicuous color pattern while the rest of body is cryptically colored. Previous studies have speculated on the role of caudal structure of P. urarachnoides in hunting. Our 2.5-year study has revealed that development of the structure of the caudal lure is commenced after birth and is linearly correlated to snout-vent length. The caudal lure attracts some species of birds. Caudal luring behavior is carried out both in the presence and absence of birds.

I briefly describe the most important results leading to this unexpected conclusion and experiments revealing the decisive role of winds at the home site. A hypothesis trying to explain the results proposes that proportional relationships among a number of atmospheric trace compounds (which determine the quality of a resulting odour) show fairly regular spatial distributions with gradient character. Gas-chromatographic analyses of air samples in an area covering 400 km in diameter revealed that differently oriented ratio gradients of volatile hydrocarbons do in fact exist. They are fairly resistant against, but not independent of, changes of wind direction. Using the measured atmospheric data as inputs, a model system is able to simulate homing navigation on a performance level similar to that observed in pigeons. Results of both pigeon experiments and air analyses are incorporated into an earlier ('preolfactory') concept of a hypothetical gradient map linked with a sun compass, which is now modified and furnished with more concrete physical substrates. Winds are identified as the crosslink embedding atmospheric ratio gradients into a directional reference scale provided by the periodically moving sun and the, geomagnetic field. Kramer's 'map-and-compass concept' is reconsidered. As crucial questions are still unsolved, olfactory navigation remains a challenge for future research.

Our objectives were to identify avian predators and describe their behavior, examine avian foraging opportunities for obtaining eggs and hatchlings, describe different foraging opportunities, and to examine differences in the time hatchlings were exposed on the sand surface to avian predators as a function of time of day, sand temperature, number of hatchlings emerging at one time, and position in the emergence order (early, middle, or late). The timing of nesting and hatchling emergence, length of the incubation period, and heavy rains provided birds with foraging opportunities. Timing is critical because: 1) females nest in every month, but hatchlings require 45-65 days to hatch, thus nesting females dig up nests from previous nestings, 2) heavy rains increase stream flow, causing bank erosion, exposing nests to avian predators, 3) strong tides expose nests to avian predators, 4) hatchlings emerging in the early morning are visible to birds, and 5) length of time for hatchlings to emerge from the nest and reach the water varies among clutches. Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus), Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), and Great-tailed Grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) accounted for most of the avian predation. Vultures foraged by searching for hatchlings on the surface, for eggs or hatchlings exposed by dogs or people, for clusters of birds around emerging hatchlings, and for opportunities to pirate eggs or hatchlings from other birds. Olive Ridleys avoid predation by predator swamping, nocturnal nesting, and nocturnal emergence of young. Humans decreased predation on hatchlings by removing debris that impedes hatchling movement to the sea, and by keeping predatory birds off the beach during the main early morning hatchling emergence period.",AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MAR,2014,101643CE13006,"[Burger, Joanna] Rutgers State Univ, Div Life Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA./[Burger, Joanna; Gochfeld, Michael] Rutgers State Univ, Environm & Occupat Hlth Sci Inst, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA./[Gochfeld, Michael] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.","Burger, J (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Div Life Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",NA

Nevertheless, little is known about the possible negative effects these anthropogenic features might have on prairie birds, one of the most threatened groups in North America. We examined radiotelemetry tracking locations of Lesser Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) and Greater Prairie-Chickens (T. cupido) in two locations in Oklahoma to determine whether these birds avoided or changed movement behavior near power lines and paved highways. We tracked 463 Lesser Prairie-Chickens (15,071 tracking locations) and 216 Greater Prairie-Chickens (5,750 locations) for 7 and 3 years, respectively. Individuals of both species avoided power lines by at least 100 m and Lesser Prairie-Chickens avoided one of the two highways by 100 m. Prairie-chickens crossed power lines less often than expected if birds moved randomly (p < 0.05) but did not appear to perceive highways as a movement barrier (p > 0.05). In addition, home ranges of Lesser Prairie-Chickens overlapped the power line less often than would be expected by chance placement of home ranges; this result was supported by kernel-density estimation of home ranges. It is likely that new power lines (and other tall structures such as wind turbines) will lead to avoidance of previously suitable habitat and will serve as barriers to movement. These two factors will likely increase fragmentation in an already fragmented landscape if wind energy development continues in prairie habitats.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,OCT,2009,101111j15231739200901254x,"[Pruett, Christin L.; Patten, Michael A.; Wolfe, Donald H.] Univ Oklahoma, Sutton Avian Res Ctr, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA./[Pruett, Christin L.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA./[Patten, Michael A.] Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA./[Patten, Michael A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73019 USA.","Pruett, CL (reprint author), Univ Oklahoma, Sutton Avian Res Ctr, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA.",NA

Significantly, beetles accumulated on the unexposed controls, indicating conspecific avoidance (i. e. behaviour designed to avoid locations previously traversed by individuals of the same species). This finding is novel and important because optimal Levy-fiight (scale-free) search patterns for the location of sparsely and randomly distributed prey resources can emerge from conspecific avoidance. This finding may account for the shortcomings of random-walk (scale-finite) models when used to predict large-scale movement and search patterns by extrapolating from observations made at small scales.

We captured and fitted 36 woodland caribou with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. These yielded 43,415 locations during the 12-month study period. We tested the hypothesis that woodland caribou use areas adjacent to wellsites, roads, and seismic lines as often as thc) use areas away fi om these developments. We analyzed caribou locations, controlling for vegetation cover classes to remove confounding effects of habitat, and grouped to examine seasonal variation in distribution. Caribou avoided human developments: the level of avoidance appeared to be related to the level of human activity in the stud) area. We recorded maximum avoidance distances of 1,000 m (wells) and 250 m (roads and seismic lines). By extrapolating avoidance distances to the entire study area, we calculated that 22-48% of our study area would receive reduced use by caribou. Avoidance effects were highest during late winter and calving and lowest during summer, possibly as a result of lower traffic levels then.

We investigated the hypothesis that the strength of road-avoidance behaviour increases with the intensity of the disturbance for a large, disturbance-sensitive herbivore: the forest-dwelling caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou. We assessed the behaviour of 53 global positioning system-collared caribou monitored during the gradual modification of a highway over a 7-year period, while controlling for potentially confounding factors. We studied caribou movements, resource selection and distribution before, during and after road modifications at multiple scales. We expected that the degree of avoidance would be positively related to road width, traffic density and the presence of active construction sites. The proportion of individuals that excluded the highway from their home range increased as highway modifications progressed. A lower proportion of caribou locations was found in a 5000 m road-effect zone during and after highway modifications compared with before. Within that zone, caribou avoided habitat types that were selected at the home range scale. Caribou displayed higher movement rates in the vicinity of the highway, especially when traffic density was high. Our data support the hypothesis that avoidance of roads by large herbivores is positively related to disturbance intensity. Our results shed light on the behavioural mechanisms determining avoidance of human infrastructure by large herbivores, and suggest that increased human activity may affect behaviour at multiple scales. Conservation efforts in areas where roads are constructed or modified should be directed towards maintaining access to critical habitat resources, while also restoring habitat quantity and quality.",WILEY,JAN,2013,101111j14697998201200959x,"[Leblond, M.; Ouellet, J. -P.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Dussault, C.] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune Quebec, Serv Faune Terr & Avifaune, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.","Leblond, M (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",NA

We answer these questions for snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in Montana, using an experimental manipulation and habitats for which annual mortality rates varied more than fourfold. We examine a) whether the mortality risk of a habitat affects movement tortuosity and speed of foraging snowshoe hares and b) whether tortuosity and speed of hares fleeing from a predator (a leashed dog, Canis familiaris) differ among these forest stands. Snowshoe hares did not differ in tortuosity or speed while foraging in these stands, suggesting that other anti-predator behaviours were used. Hares fleeing from the leashed dog showed much faster and straighter movements than foraging hares, but escape trajectories were similar in all forest stands, suggesting a relatively inflexible response while fleeing. Varying tortuosity and speed are clearly part of the snowshoe hare's behavioural repertoire for escaping predation, but these attributes of movement were insensitive to the annual mortality rates in each forest stand.",TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,2014,1029802123666,"[Hodges, Karen E.; Cunningham, Julie A.

We found that spurious heritabilities are generated under a wide range of conditions both in experimental and correlative estimates of heritability.

Avoiding the scale sampling problem: A consilient solution,2323,"Bissonette, J. A.",NA,NA,NA,"What if there was a way to solve one of the most complex and important scale challenges that ecologists face: the selection of the appropriate sampling scale resolution and extent when conducting studies. To date, the investigator conducting any study has been tasked with this challenge. Qualitatively different patterns arise as the scale resolution or extent of the observation is changed. Likewise, different patterns arise as the scales of the sampling are changed. Too often, data at one resolution are aggregated or interpretations of patterns at smaller scale resolutions and extents are extrapolated to larger extents. When this is done, either modifiable areal unit problems or extrapolation errors arise. I argue that consilient developments in movement ecology, graph (network) theory and analyses, and important technical advances in biologging can be linked synergistically to directly address the sampling scale problem, particularly in studies where understanding animal response to changing landscapes is the goal. The essence of the solution is that rather than having to decide the spatial extent and resolution to use, the issue is avoided by allowing the telemetered animal to show the relevant scales it uses as it moves during its daily, seasonal, and annual activities. The consilient result is that big data at the appropriate scales can be extracted rather than aggregated as is now the rule. Without data aggregation, no modifiable areal unit problems are involved because the dynamics are network based. Additionally, use of first passage time methodology and measurement of area-restricted movements allow assessments of the scales of activity and the effects of environmental covariates on animal movement. I begin with a brief history of the concept of scale, describing what is considered to be the essence of the problem. I follow with a brief explanation of the developments in movement ecology, graph theory and analysis, and the technical advancements in biologging with examples from studies of wildlife species that are using these new developments. I then describe how their consilient integration can provide a different way of thinking about scale resolution and extent in ecology and suggest how ecologists can avoid the observer sampling scale complication by making a critical scale distinction and by using first passage time analyses. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.
Recent developments in movement theory, network analyses, and biologging, coupled with first passage time analyses, allow a new approach to habitat selection and the possibility to avoid troublesome scale sampling problems.

However, practice alone is not responsible for the acquisition of all skill; performance can improve between, not just within, practice sessions. An important principle shaping these offline improvements may be an individual's awareness of learning a new skill. New skills, such as a sequence of finger movements, can be learned unintentionally (with little awareness for the sequence, implicit learning) or intentionally (explicit learning). We measured skill in an implicit and explicit sequence-learning task before and after a 12 hr interval. This interval either did (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) or did not (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.) include a period of sleep. Following explicit sequence learning, offline skill improvements were only observed when the 12 hr interval included sleep. This overnight improvement was correlated with the amount of NREM sleep. The same improvement could also be observed in the evening (with an interval from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m.), so it was not coupled to retesting at a particular time of day and cannot therefore be attributed to circadian factors. In contrast, in the implicit learning task, offline learning was observed regardless of whether the 12 hr interval did or did not contain a period of sleep. However, these improvements were not observed with only a 15 min interval between sessions. Therefore, the practice available within each session cannot account for these skill improvements. Instead, sufficient time is necessary for off line learning to occur. These results show a behavioral dissociation, based upon an individual's awareness for having learned a sequence of finger movements.

A CSCL-environment was augmented with a peer feedback tool (Radar) and a reflection tool (Reflector) in order to make group members aware of both their individual and their group behavior. Radar visualizes how group members perceive their own social and cognitive performance and that of their peers during collaboration along five dimensions. Reflector stimulates group members to reflect upon their own performance and the performance of the group. A 2 x 2 factorial between-subjects design was used to examine whether Radar and Reflector would lead to better team development, more group satisfaction, lower levels of group conflict, more positive attitudes toward problem-based collaboration, and a better group product. Results show that groups with Radar perceived their team as being better developed, experienced lower conflict levels, and had a more positive attitude towards collaborative problem solving than groups without Radar. The quality of group products, however, did not differ. The results demonstrate that peer feedback on the social performance of individual group members can enhance the performance and attitudes of a CSCL-group. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We contend that a careful examination of the isolated microtubule experimental record does not support motor pauses. Rather, we believe that the data suggests that motor cargo complexes encounter an obstruction that prevents procession, eventually detach and reattach, with this obstructed-detach-reattach sequence being observed in axon as a ""pause."" Based on this, along with our quantitative evidence-based contention that slow and fast axonal transport are actually single and multi-motor transport, we have developed a cargo level motor model capable of exhibiting the full range of slow to fast transport solely by changing the number of motors involved. This computational model derived using first-order kinetics is suitable for both kinesin and dynein and includes load-dependence as well as provision for motors encountering obstacles to procession. The model makes the following specific predictions: average distance from binding to obstruction is about 10 mu m; average motor maximum velocity is at least 6 mu m/s in axon; a minimum of 10 motors is required for the fastest fast transport while only one motor is required for slow transport; individual in-vivo cargo-attached motors may spend as little as 5% of their time processing along a microtubule with the remainder being spent either obstructed or unbound to a microtubule; and at least in the case of neurofilament transport, kinesin and dynein are largely not being in a ""tug-of-war"" competition.

When the populations themselves are linked by interspecific interactions, such as predation, differential movement between habitats may lead to counterintuitive system-wide dynamics. Understanding the interaction between local drivers and dynamics of widely dispersed species is necessary to predict the impacts of habitat fragmentation and degradation, which may be transmitted across habitat boundaries by species' movements. Here we model predator-prey interactions across unaltered and degraded habitat areas, and we explore the additional effects of adaptive habitat choice by predators on the resilience of prey populations. We show how movement between habitats can produce the bad neighbor effect, in which predators' response to localized habitat degradation causes system-wide loss of prey populations. This effect arises because adaptive foraging results in the concentration of predators in the more productive unaltered habitat, even when this habitat can not support the increased prey mortality. The mechanisms underlying this effect are especially sensitive to prey dispersal rate and adaptive predator behavior.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,OCT,2016,101002ecy1480,"[Noonburg, Erik G.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3200 Coll Ave, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA./[Byers, James E.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","Noonburg, EG (reprint author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3200 Coll Ave, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",NA

Morgan, DG",WILDLIFE RES,ACID,NA,"In a free-choice experiment conducted in a series of pen trials, the influence of food preference on caching behaviour by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was investigated for three unpoisoned bait types: deep-fried beef liver (DFL), dried deep-fried beef liver (DDFL) and a commercial bait (Foxoff(R)). Although some variation in individual preferences for the DDFL and Foxoff was observed, all of the foxes in the pen trials preferred the DFL (P < 0.01) and all cached it least often (P < 0.01). Field trials then compared the uptake, consumption and incidence of caching for the most preferred (DFL) and least preferred (Foxoff) bait types. Radio-transmitters were inserted into unpoisoned Foxoff and DFL baits and a free choice of either was provided at bait stations at three independent sites. A clock module recorded the precise time that each bait was taken from the bait station. The fate of each bait (it could either be eaten, cached or remain in situ) was recorded daily and baits were replaced for five consecutive nights. There was no difference in the rate of uptake for the two baits (P > 0.05) and, despite some variation between the sites, DFL was the most often eaten (P < 0.001) and Foxoff the most often cached (P < 0.001). These data strongly suggest that a highly palatable bait will increase the likelihood of rapid consumption of baits and reduce the incidence of caching. This is likely to increase the cost-effectiveness of baiting and limit the potential for nontarget impacts due to the movement of baits. The high degree of concordance between the results of the pen and field trials suggests that pen trials can assist in the development of more effective bait types. However, conclusions about the relative efficacy of bait types drawn from the results of baiting programs that measure only bait uptake are unlikely to be reliable.",C S I R O PUBLISHING,NA,2001,101071WR00046,"Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia./Victorian Inst Anim Sci, Frankston, Vic 3199, Australia.","Petel, AMV (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",10_1071_WR00046

"Balancing Biomechanical Constraints: Optimal Escape Speeds When There Is
a Trade-off between Speed and Maneuverability",3794,"Clemente, C. J.
Wilson, R. S.",NA,NA,NA,"The ability for prey to escape a pursuing predator is dependent both on the prey's speed away from the threat and on their ability to rapidly change directions, or maneuverability. Given that the biomechanical trade-off between speed and maneuverability limits the simultaneous maximization of both performance traits, animals should not select their fastest possible speeds when running away from a pursuing predator but rather a speed that maximizes the probability of successful escape. We explored how variation in the relationship between speed and maneuverability-or the shape of the trade-off-affects the optimal choice of speed for escaping predators. We used tablet-based games that simulated interactions between predators and prey (human subjects acting as predators attempting to capture ""prey"" moving across a screen). By defining a specific relationship between speed and maneuverability, we could test the survival of each of the possible behavioral choices available to this phenotype, i.e., the best combination of speed and maneuverability for prey fitness, based on their ability to escape. We found that the shape of the trade-off function affected the prey's optimal speed for success in escaping, the prey's maximum performance in escaping, and the breadth of speeds over which the prey's performance was high. The optimal speed for escape varied only when the trade-off between speed and maneuverability was non-linear. Phenotypes possessing trade-off functions for which maneuverability was only compromised at high speeds exhibited lower optimal speeds. Phenotypes that exhibited greater increases in maneuverability for any decrease in speed were more likely to have broader ranges of performance, meaning that individuals could attain their maximum performance across a broader range of speeds. We also found that there was a differential response of the subject's learning to these different components of locomotion. With increased experience through repeated trials, subjects were able to successfully catch faster and faster dots. However, no improvement was observed in the subject's ability to capture more maneuverable prey. Our work highlights the costs of high-speed movement on other traits, including maneuverability, which make the use of an animal's fastest speeds unlikely, even when attempting to escape predators. By investigating the shape of the trade-off functions between speed and maneuverability and the way the environment and morphology mediates this trade-off, we can begin to understand why animals choose to move at the speeds they do when they are running away from predators or attempting to capture prey.",NA,DEC,2015,101093icbicv103,NA,NA,NA

In sporting duels such as an attacker vs. a defender in rugby, successful body orientation/reorientation strategies are essential for successful performance. The aim of this study is to examine which biomechanical factors, while taking into account biomechanical constraints, are used by an attacker in a 1 vs. 1 duel in rugby. More specifically we wanted to examine how an attacker tries to deceive the defender yet disguise his intentions by comparing effective deceptive movements (DM(+)), ineffective deceptive movements (DM(-)), and non-deceptive movements (NDM). Eight French amateur expert rugby union players were asked to perform DMs and NDMs in a real 1 vs. 1 duel. For each type of movement (DM(+), DM(-), NDM) different relevant orientation/reorientation parameters, medio-lateral displacement of the center of mass (COM), foot, head, upper trunk, and lower trunk yaw; and upper trunk roll were analyzed and compared. Results showed that COM displacement and lower trunk yaw were minimized during DMs while foot displacement along with head and upper trunk yaw were exaggerated during DMs (DM(+) and DM(-)). This would suggest that the player is using exaggerated body-related information to consciously deceive the defender into thinking he will run in a given direction while minimizing other postural control parameters to disguise a sudden change in posture necessary to modify final running direction. Further analysis of the efficacy of deceptive movements showed how the disguise and deceit strategies needed to be carefully balanced to successfully fool the defender. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ecologists seek to understand the effects of disturbance on ecological systems and to use disturbance to modify habitats degraded by anthropogenic change. Demographic responses by plants to disturbance are often well described, but demographic responses by animals are less understood. This limits development of applied strategies that leverage disturbance to augment animal populations.
2. We estimated demographic and behavioural responses of an endangered butterfly, Fender's blue, Plebejus icarioides fenderi, to experimental burning in Oregon, USA. We monitored butterfly vital rates for 4 years post-fire.
3. Prescribed fire killed Fender's blue larvae. However, fecundity was higher relative to reference/unburned areas for 2 years after the burn and overwinter larval survivorship was higher for a year after the burn. Fire treatments did not influence adult movement behaviour.
4. We used matrix models to project butterfly population dynamics in fire-driven successional landscapes. We compared optimal burn strategies given targeted burns, such as prescribed fire, to undirected burns, such as wildfires. Disturbance enhances population growth rate under both strategies, and the optimal proportion of landscape burned is similar in both cases. However, targeted burning leads to substantially higher population growth rates.
5. Synthesis and applications. Demographic models allow planning of long-term and large-scale disturbance by balancing initial costs of disturbance with subsequent benefits. We use matrix models to project population growth in fire-driven successional landscapes and contrast prescribed burns with undirected burns (wildfires). We also use these models to evaluate the influence of local vs. non-local dispersal. Because random (non-local) dispersal allows individuals to disperse into areas that were just burned, non-local dispersal always increases population growth rates in this system. This contrasts with source-sink dynamics in stationary environments, in which local dispersal leads to higher population growth rates. Our matrix modelling approach has broad application to other disturbance-dependent taxa surviving in anthropogenically modified landscapes, and could be more widely applied to animal populations.",WILEY,MAR,2018,1.01111136526641E+018,"[Warchola, Norah; Crone, Elizabeth E.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA./[Schultz, Cheryl B.] Washington State Univ, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.","Schultz, CB (reprint author), Washington State Univ, Vancouver, WA 98686 USA.",10_1111_1365_2664_12983

Since these processes are confounded, their relative importance in shaping foraging distributions remains poorly understood. Here we aimed to rank the contribution of density-dependent and density-independent effects on the spatio-temporal foraging patterns of eurasian oystercatchers. In our intertidal study area, tides caused continuous variation in oystercatcher density, providing an opportunity to disentangle conspecific interference and density-independent interactions with the food landscape. Spatial distributions were quantified using high-resolution individual tracking of foraging activity and location. In a model environment that included a realistic reconstruction of both the tides and the benthic food, we tested a family of behaviour-based optimality models against these tracking data. Density-independent interactions affected spatial distributions much more strongly than conspecific interference, even in an interference-prone species like oystercatchers. Spatial distributions were governed by avoidance of bill injury costs, selection for high interference-free intake rates and a decreasing availability of benthic bivalve prey after their exposure. These density-independent interactions outweighed interference competition in terms of effect size. We suggest that the bottleneck in our mechanistic understanding of foraging distributions may be primarily the role of density-independent prey attributes unrelated to intake rates, like damage costs in the case of oystercatchers foraging on perilous prey. At a landscape scale, above the finest inter-individual distances, effects of conspecific interaction on spatial distributions may have been overemphasised.",WILEY,AUG,2017,101111oik04139,"[Dokter, Adriaan M.; van Loon, E.

Amphibians overwintering in ice-covered ponds and lakes offer an ecologically relevant test of this response since they must choose between the confounding metabolic effects of profound hypothermia or hypoxia; thermal and chemical conditions can vary from 0 degrees C and normoxic at the ice-water interface to 4 degrees C and markedly hypoxic at depths of 2-4m. To mimic such environmental conditions, we constructed an experimental chamber that enabled continuous electronic surveillance of an animal's movement along a thermal gradient. When Rana temporaria pre-acclimated to 3.5 degrees C were placed in a normoxic thermal gradient ranging from 0.8 to 8 degrees C, they invariably favoured the warmer end of the chamber.

DANIO-RERIO; CHOICE; PREFERENCES",NA,"Background: Grouping behaviour, common across the animal kingdom, is known to reduce an individual's risk of predation; particularly through dilution of individual risk and predator confusion (predator inability to single out an individual for attack). Theory predicts greater risk of predation to individuals more conspicuous to predators by difference in appearance from the group (the 'oddity' effect). Thus, animals should choose group mates close in appearance to themselves (eg. similar size), whilst also choosing a large group.
Methodology and Principal Findings: We used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a well known model species of group-living freshwater fish, in a series of binary choice trials investigating the outcome of conflict between preferences for large and phenotypically matched groups along a predation risk gradient. We found body-size dependent differences in the resultant social decisions. Large fish preferred shoaling with size-matched individuals, while small fish demonstrated no preference. There was a trend towards reduced preferences for the matched shoal under increased predation risk. Small fish were more active than large fish, moving between shoals more frequently. Activity levels increased as predation risk decreased. We found no effect of unmatched shoal size on preferences or activity.
Conclusions and Significance: Our results suggest that predation risk and individual body size act together to influence shoaling decisions. Oddity was more important for large than small fish, reducing in importance at higher predation risks. Dilution was potentially of limited importance at these shoal sizes. Activity levels may relate to how much sampling of each shoal was needed by the test fish during decision making. Predation pressure may select for better decision makers to survive to larger size, or that older, larger fish have learned to make shoaling decisions more efficiently, and this, combined with their size relative to shoal-mates, and attractiveness as prey items influences shoaling decisions.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUL 5,2011,101371journalpone0014819,"[Rodgers, Gwendolen M.; Ward, Jonathan R.; Askwith, Beth; Morrell, Lesley J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England./[Morrell, Lesley J.] Univ Hull, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.","Rodgers, GM (reprint author), Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat & Comparat Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",10_1371_journal_pone_0014819

Some rattlesnakes traveled great distances (over 11km) from the dens compared to the other species (bullsnake max.=4km; racer max.=5km), which may be a result of their selected macrohabitat being more patchily distributed in the landscape.

This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently.

Wulder, Michael A.",NA,NA,NA,"Fire regimes are changing throughout the North American boreal forest in complex ways. Fire is also a major factor governing access to high-quality forage such as terricholous lichens for barren-ground caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). Additionally, fire alters forest structure which can affect barren-ground caribou's ability to navigate in a landscape. Here, we characterize how the size and severity of fires are changing across five barren-ground caribou herd ranges in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. Additionally, we demonstrate how time since fire, fire severity, and season result in complex changes in caribou behavioural metrics estimated using telemetry data. Fire disturbances were identified using novel gap-free Landsat surface reflectance composites from 1985 to 2011 across all herd ranges. Burn severity was estimated using the differenced normalized burn ratio. Annual area burned and burn severity were assessed through time for each herd and related to two behavioural metrics: velocity and relative turning angle. Neither annual area burned nor burn severity displayed any temporal trend within the study period. However, certain herds, such as the Ahiak/Beverly, have more exposure to fire than other herds (i.e. Cape Bathurst had a maximum forested area burned of less than 4 km 2). Time since fire and burn severity both significantly affected velocity and relative turning angles. During fall, winter, and spring, fire virtually eliminated foraging-focused behaviour for all 26 years of analysis while more severe fires resulted in a marked increase in movement-focused behaviour compared to unburnt patches. Between seasons, caribou used burned areas as early as 1-year postfire, demonstrating complex, nonlinear reactions to time since fire, fire severity, and season. In all cases, increases in movement-focused behaviour were detected postfire. We conclude that changes in caribou behaviour immediately postfire are primarily driven by changes in forest structure rather than changes in terricholous lichen availability.",NA,MAR,2017,101111gcb13456,NA,NA,NA

Roads act as barriers by impeding animal movements and restricting space use. Understanding factors that influence barrier effects is important to discern the impacts of habitat fragmentation and to develop appropriate mitigations. We combined telemetry and demographic data in 2008 to 2012 with remote sensing imagery to investigate barrier effects of forest roads and assess effects of traffic, road edges, and canopy gaps on space use of an endangered, endemic forest obligate, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis). We mapped low to high traffic roads, road edges, canopy gaps, and random lines in forests to serve as references. We determined if red squirrels included these linear features in their total and core home ranges, and used this metric as an indicator of crossing and preference for habitat adjacent to the linear features. Forest roads acted as barriers regardless of traffic volume and had long-term impacts on animal space use. Animals did not avoid entering roadside areas, and probability of crossing linear features in the forest was not affected by distance to roads. In contrast, greater canopy cover increased probability of crossing, and gaps in canopy impeded animal movements. Higher likelihood of road crossing was associated with more variable tree height and mating activity. We demonstrated that narrow forest roads with low traffic volume were barriers for forest dependent species, and suggest that gap avoidance inhibits road crossings.

Wind farms, both operational and in planning, can be expected to impact negatively on wildlife populations, particularly birds. We propose a novel approach to assess the impacts through the energetic costs of avoidance behaviour for a long-distance, migratory seaduck. Flight trajectories were recorded using surveillance radar at a Danish offshore wind farm with emphasis placed on the 200 000+ migrating common eiders that pass through the area annually. Minimum distance to wind farm and curvature of trajectories were compared pre- and post-construction. Additional costs of the avoidance response were estimated using an avian energetic model. The curvature of eider trajectories was greatest post-construction and within 500 m of the wind farm, with a median curvature significantly greater than pre-construction, suggesting that the birds adjusted their flight paths in the presence of the wind farm. Additional distance travelled as a consequence of the wind farm's presence was ca. 500 m and trivial compared with the total costs of a migration episode of 1400 km. However, construction of further wind farms along the migration route could have cumulative effects on the population, especially when considered in combination with other human actions.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,MAY,2009,101093icesjmsfsp031,"[Masden, Elizabeth A.; Haydon, Daniel T.; Furness, Robert W.] Univ Glasgow, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland./[Fox, Anthony D.; Desholm, Mark] Univ Aarhus, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Biodivers, Natl Environm Res Inst, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark./[Bullman, Rhys] Univ Stirling, Beta Ctr, Stirling FK9 4NF, Scotland.","Masden, EA (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",NA

Nine crabs were tagged with ultrasonic transmitters and their positions were monitored approximately every third minute for 9-24 days. Because the crabs sometimes hid, the signals were often received improperly, resulting in inaccurate position fixes, and a computer program to distinguish between movement and inactivity was developed.
Edible crabs showed a nocturnal activity cycle. During the day crabs were in hiding as indicated by less accurate position fixes. There were variations in activity levels both between and within individuals. Three crabs hardly moved at all during the study, while the others were active during some, or all nights. The crabs did not return to the same place after movement, but stayed close to the hydrophone triangle (290 x 350 x 175 m) throughout the study. The activity and movement patterns are discussed in relation to optimal foraging behaviour and predator avoidance.
Six baited pots were set in the area on seven nights. Four of the crabs located baited pots during the study. Three crabs located pots more than once, resulting in a total of nine localisations. Three of the tagged crabs were caught. The localisations of baited pots were divided into four categories on the basis of the current direction at the start of the localisation and whether the crab was caught or not, in order to suggest the probability of the localisation being chemically stimulated. At least six of the localisations seemed to be induced by chemical attraction to the bait. Pots were always located during night at the time of high activity.

We tested the hypothesis that the largely white winter fur of hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), originating from Asian steppes, may be related to camouflage to permit sun basking on or near snow. Winter-acclimated hamsters in our study were largely white and had a high proclivity to bask when resting and torpid. Resting hamsters reduced metabolic rate (MR) significantly (>30%) when basking at ambient temperatures (T-a) of similar to 15 and 0 degrees C. Interestingly, body temperature (T-b) also was significantly reduced from 34.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C (T-a 15 degrees C, not basking) to 30.4 +/- 2.0 degrees C (T-a 0 degrees C, basking), which resulted in an extremely low (<50% of predicted) apparent thermal conductance. Induced torpor (food withheld) during respirometry at T-a 15 degrees C occurred on 83.3 +/- 36.0% of days and the minimum torpor MR was 36% of basal MR at an average T-b of 22.0 +/- 2.6 degrees C; movement to the basking lamp occurred at T-b<20.0 degrees C. Energy expenditure for rewarming was significantly reduced (by >50%) during radiant heat-assisted rewarming; however, radiant heat per se without an endogenous contribution by animals did not strongly affect metabolism and T-b during torpor. Our data show that basking substantially modifies thermal energetics in hamsters, with a drop of resting T-b and MR not previously observed and a reduction of rewarming costs. The energy savings afforded by basking in hamsters suggest that this behaviour is of energetic significance not only for mammals living in deserts, where basking is common, but also for P. sungorus and probably other cold-climate mammals.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,JUL 15,2016,101242jeb137828,"[Geiser, Fritz; Gasch, Kristina; Bieber, Claudia; Stalder, Gabrielle L.; Gerritsmann, Hanno; Ruf, Thomas] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria./[Geiser, Fritz] Univ New England, Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Zool, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.","Geiser, F (reprint author), Univ Vet Med Vienna, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Res Inst Wildlife Ecol, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria.; Geiser, F (reprint author), Univ New England, Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Zool, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",NA

Techniques such as light-based geolocation have provided great insights into individual movements, but currently available data do not permit extrapolation to the population level. Public recording schemes may, however, help to fill shortfalls in data gathering, especially when analysed in conjunction with data from these other techniques. We analysed 11 781 records (from 1988 to 2008) from 2 public recording databases operating in the UK. We describe 3 sightings hotspots: western Scotland, Isle of Man and southwest England, and highlight the marked seasonality of basking shark sightings, which were at their greatest during the northeast Atlantic summer (June to August). We further highlight a significant correlation between the duration of the sightings season in each year and the North Atlantic Oscillation, an atmosphere-ocean climate oscillation that has been linked to forcing of marine ecosystems. We augment patterns from public sightings records with effort-related data collected by boat-based transects at 2 regional sightings hotspots (western Scotland and southwest England). Analysis of reported body size data indicated that the annual proportion of small sharks (<4 m length) sighted by the public decreased, the proportion of medium-sized sharks sighted (4-6 m) increased, and the proportion of large sharks sighted (>6 m) remained constant.

We marked 3440 bats belonging to 44 species and recaptured 151 belonging to 14 species. The average distance between extra-site recaptures was 2.2 km. With the exception of bats marked in fragments and recaptured in forests, all other possible inter-habitat recaptures were observed. We selected 23 bats of 8 species for radiotelemetry and the areas used by them varied from 65 to 530 ha. Some species restricted their activity to the vicinity of their roosts, rarely moving more than 500 m away, but others traveled greater distances between roosts and foraging areas. All tracked bats flew over savannas, crossing distances from 0.5 to 2.5 km. Roost location and type varied among species, from individuals roosting alone in the foliage to colonies in buildings. Bats were highly mobile and savannas did not appear to inhibit the movements of some species, suggesting that a persistent biological flow may be maintained among isolated fragments, with bats acting as pollinators and seed dispersers.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUN,2003,101111j174474292003tb00285x,"York Univ, Dept Biol, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.","Bernard, E (reprint author), Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Caixa Postal 37, BR-37200000 Lavras, MG, Brazil.",NA

Numerous studies attempted to model it [2-7] with little supporting evidence. Studying it in the wild is difficult because it requires monitoring the animal's movement, its foraging success, and its interactions with conspecifics. We present a novel system that enables full night ultrasonic recording of freely foraging bats, in addition to GPS tracking. As they rely on echolocation, audio recordings of bats allow tapping into their sensory acquisition of the world [8]. Rapid changes in echolocation allowed us to reveal the bats' dynamic reactions in response to prey or conspecifics-two key behaviors that are extremely difficult to assess in most animals. We found that bats actively aggregate and forage as a group. However, we also found that when the group became too dense, bats were forced to devote sensory attention to conspecifics that frequently entered their biosonar ""field of view,"" impairing the bats' prey detection performance. Why then did bats fly in such high densities? By emitting echolocation calls, bats constantly provide public information about their detection of prey. Bats could therefore benefit from intentionally flying at a distance that enables eavesdropping on conspecifics. Group foraging, therefore, probably allowed bats to effectively operate as an array of sensors, increasing their searching efficiency [4, 6]. We suggest that two opposing forces are at play in determining the efficient foraging density: on the one hand, higher densities improve prey detection, but on the other hand, they increase conspecific interference.",CELL PRESS,JAN 19,2015,101016jcub201411010,"[Cvikel, Noam; Berg, Katya Egert; Borissov, Ivailo; Boonman, Arjan; Amichai, Eran; Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel./[Berg, Katya Egert; Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel./[Levin, Eran] Univ Arizona, Dept Entomol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA./[Hurme, Edward] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","Yovel, Y (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",NA

To land, a bat must perform an acrobatic flip that brings the claws of the toes in contact with the ceiling and do so gently enough as to avoid injury to its slender hindlimbs. In the present study, we sought to determine how bats land, to seek a link between landing kinematics and ceiling impact forces, and to determine whether landing strategies vary among bat species. To do this, we measured the kinematics and kinetics of landing behaviour in three species of bats as they landed on a force-measuring platform (Cynopterus brachyotis, N=3; Carollia perspicillata, N=5; Glossophaga soricina, N=5). Kinematics were similar for all bats within a species but differed among species. C. brachyotis performed four-point landings, during which body pitch increased until the ventral surface of the body faced the ceiling and the thumbs and hindlimbs simultaneously grasped the surface. Bats of the other two species performed two-point landings, whereby only the hindlimbs made contact with the ceiling. During these two-point landings, the hindlimbs were drawn up the side of the body to come in contact with the ceiling, causing simultaneous changes in body pitch, roll and yaw over the course of the landing sequence. Right-handed and left-handed forms of the two-point landing were observed, with individuals often switching back and forth between them among landing events. The four-point landing of C. brachyotis resulted in larger peak forces (3.7 +/- 2.4 body weights; median +/- interquartile range) than the two-point landings of C. perspicillata (0.8 +/- 0.6 body weights) or G. soricina (0.8 +/- 0.2 body weights). Our results demonstrate that the kinematics and kinetics of landing vary among bat species and that there is a correlation between the way a bat moves its body when it lands and the magnitude of peak impact force it experiences during that landing. We postulate that these interspecific differences in impact force could result because of stronger selective pressure for gentle landing in cave-roosting (C. perspicillata, G. soricina) versus foliage-roosting (C. brachyotis) species.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,APR 1,2009,101242jeb026161,"[Riskin, Daniel K.; Bahlman, Joseph W.; Swartz, Sharon M.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA./[Hubel, Tatjana Y.; Swartz, Sharon M.] Brown Univ, Div Engn, Providence, RI 02912 USA./[Ratcliffe, John M.] Univ So Denmark, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark./[Kunz, Thomas H.] Boston Univ, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA.","Riskin, DK (reprint author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",NA

Bats display remarkable navigation capabilities, ranging from nightly commutes of several kilometers and up to seasonal migrations over thousands of kilometers [5]. Many bats have been suggested to fly along fixed routes termed ""flyways,'' when flying from their roost to their foraging sites [6]. Flyways commonly stretch along linear landscape elements such as tree lines, hedges, or rivers [7]. When flying along a flyway, bats must estimate the distance they have traveled in order to determine when to turn. This can be especially challenging when moving along a repetitive landscape. Some bats, like Kuhl's pipistrelles, which we studied here, have limited vision [8] and were suggested to rely on bio-sonar for navigation. These bats could therefore estimate distance using three main sensory-navigation strategies, all of which we have examined: acoustic flow, acoustic landmarks, or path integration. We trained bats to fly along a linear flyway and land on a platform. We then tested their behavior when the platform was removed under different manipulations, including changing the acoustic flow, moving the start point, and adding wind. We found that bats do not require acoustic flow, which was hypothesized to be important for their navigation [9-15], and that they can perform the task without landmarks. Our results suggest that Kuhl's pipistrelles use internal self-motion cues-also known as path integration-rather than external information to estimate flight distance for at least dozens of meters when navigating along linear flyways.",CELL PRESS,DEC 4,2017,101016jcub201710012,"[Aharon, Gal; Sadot, Meshi; Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel./[Yovel, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","Aharon, G; Yovel, Y (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Yovel, Y (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",10_1016_j_cub_2017_10_012

An overview about the whole project and its parts like sensor node design, tracking grid and software infrastructure is given and the evaluation of the project is shown. The BATS project includes a lightweight sensor node that is attached to bats and combines multiple features. Communication among sensor nodes allows tracking of bat encounters. Flight trajectories of individual tagged bats can be recorded at high spatial and temporal resolution by a ground node grid. To increase the communication range, the BATS project implemented a long-range telemetry system to still receive sensor data outside the standard ground node network.

Bayesian methods allow the contributions of multiple data sources to be decomposed into manageable components. We illustrate with two examples for two different location methods: satellite tracking and light level geo-location. We show that many of the problems with uncertainty involved are reduced and quantified by our approach. This approach can use any available information, such as existing knowledge of the animal's potential range, light levels or direct location estimates, auxiliary data, and movement models.

Statistical methods to analyze movement have responded, becoming ever more complex, often relying on state-space modeling. Estimation of movement metrics such as utilization distributions have not followed suit, relying primarily on kernel density estimation. Here we consider a method for making inference about space use that is free of all of the major problems associated with kernel density estimation of utilization distributions such as autocorrelation, irregular time gaps, and error in observed locations. Our proposed method is based on a data augmentation approach that defines use as a summary of the complete path of the animal which is only partially observed. We use a sample from the posterior distribution of the complete path to construct a posterior sample for the metric of interest. Three basic importance sampling based methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of the path are proposed and compared.

Here we aim to bolster usage by developing a continuous-time model with interpretable parameters, similar to those of popular discrete-time models that use turning angles and step lengths. Movement is defined by a joint bearing and speed process, with parameters dependent on a continuous-time behavioural switching process, creating a flexible class of movement models. Methodology is presented for Markov chain Monte Carlo inference given irregular observations, involving augmenting observed locations with a reconstruction of the underlying movement process. This is applied to well-known GPS data from elk (Cervus elaphus), which have previously been modelled in discrete time.

One of the fundamental problems is that it is difficult to disentangle inherent movement behavior from sampling artifacts. For example, in a typical study design, short distances are sampled more frequently than long distances. Here we present a modeling-based alternative that combines a diffusion-based process model with an observation model to infer the inherent movement behavior of the species from the data. The movement model is based on classifying the landscape into a number of habitat types, and assuming habitat-specific diffusion and mortality parameters, and habitat selection at edges between the habitat types. As the problem is computationally highly intensive, we provide software that implements adaptive Bayesian methods for effective sampling of the posterior distribution. We illustrate the modeling framework by analyzing individual mark-recapture data on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), and by comparing our results with earlier ones derived from the same data using a purely statistical approach. We use simulated data to perform an analysis of statistical power, examining how accuracy in parameter estimates depends on the amount of data and on the study design. Obtaining precise estimates for movement rates and habitat preferences turns out to be especially challenging, as these parameters can be highly correlated in the posterior density. We show that the parameter estimates can be considerably improved by alternative study designs, such as releasing some of the individuals into the unsuitable matrix, or spending part of the recapture effort in the matrix.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,FEB,2008,1018900704431,"[Ovaskainen, Otso; Meyke, Evgeniy] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland./[Rekola, Hanna; Arjas, Elja] Univ Helsinki, Dept Math & Stat, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.","Ovaskainen, O (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 65 Viikinkaari 1, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",NA

Given the importance of sensing motion for obstacle avoidance, it is surprising that humans make errors, reporting an object will miss them when it is on a collision course with their head. Here we provide evidence that biases observed when participants estimate movement in depth result from the brain's use of a ""prior"" favoring slow velocity. We formulate a Bayesian model for computing 3D motion using independently estimated parameters for the shape of the visual system's slow velocity prior. We demonstrate the success of this model in accounting for human behavior in separate experiments that assess both sensitivity and bias in 3D motion estimation.

Here we compare the parameter estimates, model fits, and predictive abilities of two models of metapopulation dynamics: a detailed individual-based model (IBM) and a population-based stochastic patch occupancy model (SPOM) derived from the IBM. The two models were fitted to a 17-year time series of data for the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabiting a network of 72 small meadows. The data consisted of biannual counts of larval groups (IBM) and the annual presence or absence of local populations (SPOM). The models were fitted using a Bayesian state-space approach with a hierarchical random effect structure to account for observational, demographic, and environmental stochasticities. The detection probability of larval groups (IBM) and the probability of false zeros of local populations (SPOM) in the observation models were simultaneously estimated from the time-series data and independent control data. Prior distributions for dispersal parameters were obtained from a separate analysis of mark-recapture data. Both models fitted the data about equally, but the results were more precise for the IBM than for the SPOM. The two models yielded similar estimates for a random effect parameter describing habitat quality in each patch, which were correlated with independent empirical measures of habitat quality. The modeling results showed that variation in habitat quality influenced patch occupancy more through the effects on movement behavior at patch edges than on carrying capacity, whereas the latter influenced the mean population size in occupied patches. The IBM and the SPOM explained 63% and 45%, respectively, of the observed variation in the fraction of occupied habitat area among 75 independent patch networks not used in parameter estimation. We conclude that, while carefully constructed, detailed models can have better predictive ability than simple models, this advantage comes with the cost of greatly increased data requirements and computational challenges.

Popular telemetry systems in marine coastal fish consist of arrays of omnidirectional acoustic receivers, which generate a multivariate time-series of detection events across the tracking period. Here we report a novel Bayesian fitting of a SSM application that couples mechanistic movement properties within a home range (a specific case of random walk weighted by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) with a model of observational error typical for data obtained from acoustic receiver arrays. We explored the performance and accuracy of the approach through simulation modelling and extensive sensitivity analyses of the effects of various configurations of movement properties and time-steps among positions. Model results show an accurate and unbiased estimation of the movement parameters, and in most cases the simulated movement parameters were properly retrieved. Only in extreme situations (when fast swimming speeds are combined with pooling the number of detections over long time-steps) the model produced some bias that needs to be accounted for in field applications. Our method was subsequently applied to real acoustic tracking data collected from a small marine coastal fish species, the pearly razorfish, Xyrichtys novacula. The Bayesian SSM we present here constitutes an alternative for those used to the Bayesian way of reasoning. Our Bayesian SSM can be easily adapted and generalized to any species, thereby allowing studies in freely roaming animals on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of home ranges and territory establishment, both in fishes and in other taxa.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 27,2016,101371journalpone0154089,"[Alos, Josep; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany./[Alos, Josep; Palmer, Miquel; Balle, Salvador] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain./[Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Fac Life Sci, Invalidenstr 42, D-10155 Berlin, Germany.","Alos, J (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany.; Alos, J (reprint author), IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain.",10_1371_journal_pone_0154089

They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2-3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2-3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 mu Pa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAR 14,2011,101371journalpone0017009,"[Tyack, Peter L.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA./[Zimmer, Walter M.

However, because the fossil record is fragmentary and reconstructing behaviour from fossils is difficult, changes in the motor control strategies that accompanied this transition remain unknown. Quadrupedal primates that adopt a bipedal stance while using percussive tools provide a unique reference point to clarify one aspect of this transition, which is maintaining bipedal stance while handling massive objects. We found that while cracking nuts using massive stone hammers, wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajits libidinosus) produce hammer trajectories with highly repeatable spatial profiles. Using an uncontrolled manifold analysis, we show that the monkeys used strong joint synergies to stabilize the hammer trajectory while lifting and lowering heavy hammers. The monkeys stringently controlled the motion of the foot. They controlled the motion of the lower arm and hand rather loosely, showing a greater variability across strikes. Overall, our findings indicate that while standing bipedally to lift and lower massive hammers, an arboreal quadrupedal primate must control motion in the joints of the lower body more stringently than motion in the joints of the upper body. Similar changes in the structure of motor variability required to accomplish this goal could have accompanied the evolutionary transition from occasional to obligate bipedalism in ancestral hominins.",ROYAL SOC,OCT 24,2018,101098rspb20181797,"[Mangalam, Madhur; Fragaszy, Dorothy Munkenbeck] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA./[Rein, Robert] German Sport Univ Cologne, Inst Training & Comp Sci Sports, D-50933 Cologne, Germany.","Mangalam, M (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",NA

Currently, despite large regulatory hurdles [5], UAVs are being deployed by researchers and conservationists to monitor threats to biodiversity [6], collect frequent aerial imagery [7-9], estimate population abundance [4, 10], and deter poaching [11]. Studies have examined the behavioral responses of wildlife to aircraft [12-20] (including UAVs [21]), but with the widespread increase in UAV flights, it is critical to understand whether UAVs act as stressors to wildlife and to quantify that impact. Biologger technology allows for the remote monitoring of stress responses in free-roaming individuals [22], and when linked to locational information, it can be used to determine events [19, 23, 24] or components of an animal's environment [25] that elicit a physiological response not apparent based on behavior alone. We assessed effects of UAV flights on movements and heart rate responses of free-roaming American black bears. We observed consistently strong physiological responses but infrequent behavioral changes.

Individual-based model","Social bees are central place foragers collecting floral resources from the surrounding landscape, but little is known about the probability of a scouting bee finding a particular flower patch. We therefore developed a software tool, BEESCOUT, to theoretically examine how bees might explore a landscape and distribute their scouting activities over time and space. An image file can be imported, which is interpreted by the model as a ""forage map"" with certain colours representing certain crops or habitat types as specified by the user. BEESCOUT calculates the size and location of these potential food sources in that landscape relative to a bee colony. An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of radar-tracked honeybees and bumblebees. Various ""search modes"" describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors. In example simulations, we find that detection probabilities for food sources close to the colony fit empirical data reasonably well. However, for food sources further away no empirical data are available to validate model output. The simulated detection probabilities depend largely on the bees' search mode, and whether they exchange information about food source locations. Nevertheless, we show that landscape structure and connectivity of food sources can have a strong impact on the results. We believe that BEESCOUT is a valuable tool to better understand how landscape configurations and searching behaviour of bees affect detection probabilities of food sources. It can also guide the collection of relevant data and the design of experiments to close knowledge gaps, and provides a useful extension to the BEEHAVE honeybee model, enabling future users to explore how landscape structure and food availability affect the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and, in consequence, to predict colony development and survival.

Behavior and numbers of marbled murrelets measured with radar,12341,"Burger, AE",J FIELD ORNITHOL,QUEEN-CHARLOTTE-ISLANDS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; DISCOVERY,NA,"I used high-frequency surveillance radar to estimate the numbers of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) entering two watersheds on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. An accurate census was possible where incoming birds were funnelled through a narrow inlet (Bedwell-Ursus watershed), but counts were less reliable on more open coastline (Carmanah Valley). An estimated minimum of 900 and 100 murrelets, respectively, entered these watersheds at dawn in June 1995, Radar yielded 5-10 times more detections than human observers using the audio-visual Pacific Seabird Group (PSG) protocol. Radar revealed a concentrated influx of murrelets 35-60 min before sunrise, but the audio-visual surveys failed to detect this peak. Most audio-visual detections occurred later, from 35 min before to 90 min after sunrise, when the radar showed intensive circling and departure behavior. This implies that audio-visual surveys underestimate the number of active nesters and sample many murrelets that might be performing aerial displays rather than commuting to nests. The radar revealed considerable activity at dusk (43% and 29% of dawn detection rates at Carmanah and Bedwell, respectively), a period not normally sampled in the PSG protocol. Birds leaving the forest for the ocean flew faster (mean 119 km/h) than incoming birds (74 km/h) or those circling over the forest (81 km/h).",ASSOC FIELD ORNITHOLOGISTS,SPR,1997,nodoi8939678691,NA,"Burger, AE (reprint author), UNIV VICTORIA,DEPT BIOL,VICTORIA,BC V8W 3N5,CANADA.",NA

The relative importance of behavioral responses to climate-induced variation in costs vs. supplies of energy, however, is uncertain, as is the degree to which such responses are mediated by current stores of energy. We evaluated relationships among behavior, nutritional condition (i.e., energy state), and spatiotemporal variation in costs vs. supplies of energy available to a large-bodied endotherm, the North American elk (Cervus elaphus), occupying two ecosystems with contrasting climates and energy landscapes: a temperate, montane forest and an arid, high-elevation desert. We hypothesized that during spring through autumn, behavioral responses to the energy landscape would be both context dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by elk in the forest vs. the desert), and state dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the energy balance of an individual). We tested several predictions derived from that hypothesis by combining output from a biophysical model of the thermal environment with data on forage quality, animal locations, and nutritional condition of individuals. At the population level, elk in the desert selected areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation over those that provided the highest-quality forage. In the forest, however, costs imposed by the thermal environment were less pronounced, and elk selected areas that increased access to high-quality forage over those that reduced costs of thermoregulation. At the individual level, nutritional condition did not influence strength of selection for low-cost areas or high-quality forage among elk in the forest. In the desert, however, strength of selection for low-cost areas (but not forage quality) was state dependent; individuals in the poorest condition at the end of winter showed the strongest selection for areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation during spring and summer, and also expended the least amount of energy on locomotion. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the roles of behavior and nutritional condition in buffering endotherms against direct and indirect effects of climate on fitness.",WILEY,AUG,2014,1018901312731,"[Long, Ryan A.; Bowyer, R.

However, the ecological consequences of such behavioral changes, such as effects on toxicant transfer in foodwebs, are far less well understood, complicated in part by the short-term nature of laboratory experiments and the lack of complementary field studies where the nature of toxicant exposure is more complex. Here we examine whether naturally exposed individuals of the round goby, a benthic, site-loyal fish, move in a manner similar to conspecifics from less contaminated habitats. In the laboratory, round goby from a relatively cleaner site showed greater activity and exploration than goby from two highly contaminated sites. Male fish were more active than females but the site effects were similar in both sexes. In contrast to laboratory findings, a field mark-recapture study of 881 round goby showed that fish from the cleaner site did not move greater distances or exhibit shorter residence times within the site than round goby from highly contaminated sites. Our results indicate that while behavioral changes in the laboratory may be one of several useful diagnostics of toxicant exposure of wild-exposed animals, they do not necessarily translate readily into measurable differences in a natural context. Thus, the potential fitness consequences of toxicant exposure based on behavioral changes need to be assessed carefully.",SPRINGER,MAY,2012,101007s106460120854y,"[Marentette, Julie R.; Tong, Stephanie; Wang, Grace; Sopinka, Natalie M.; Taves, Matthew D.; Balshine, Sigal] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada./[Koops, Marten A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Burlington, ON, Canada.","Marentette, JR (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",10_1007_s10646_012_0854_y

Little has been published about behavioral changes in lame sows. Ketoprofen is an effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat non-infectious locomotor disorders in pigs. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lameness and lameness-related pain on the behavior of sows. To evaluate this effect, we studied whether pain alleviation with ketoprofen and clinical relief of lameness were associated with changes in behavior. We allocated randomly 13 lame, early pregnancy sows in three treatment groups receiving either ketoprofen 4 mg/kg, ketoprofen 2 mg/kg (these two groups were pooled for statistical analyses) or placebo. The animals were treated orally for 5 days and lameness scored before and on the last day of the treatment. Lameness was assessed with a 5-grade scoring system and behavior by scan sampling method. A clinically healthy, non-lame control sow was paired with each lame sow and they were examined the same way as lame sows but received no treatment. Lame sows were more passive, they lay more and stood and explored pen fixtures less than the control sows before treatment. After 5-days treatment, placebo-treated sows were in contact with the wall and lying more often when compared to control sows. Ketoprofen-treated sows were more seldom in contact with the wall and exploring bedding more often than placebo-treated sows. Placebo sows tended also to move and explore bedding less than control sows. Lameness had been relieved in altogether 7 out of 13 sows on day 5: six out of nine ketoprofen-medicated sows and one out of four placebo-treated sows. The behaviour of sows with relieved lameness did not differ from that of control sows on day 5. Sows with non-relieved lameness were in contact with the wall and lying more and moving and standing less than control sows. When compared to control sows, sows with non-relieved lameness tended to be more passive. When compared to sows with relieved lameness, sows with non-relieved lameness showed a tendency to be in contact with the wall more often. Our study showed that lameness reduces the activity of sows and affects their position in the pen. Passive behavior seemed at least partly be due to pain and lameness relief was associated with normalization of the behavior.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AUG,2017,101016japplanim201703017,"[Ala-Kurikka, Eve; Heinonen, Mari; Valros, Anna] Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Prod Anim Med, Res Ctr Anim Welfare, POB 57, Helsinki 00014, Finland./[Heinonen, Mari; Mustonen, Katja; Peltoniemi, Olli] Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Prod Anim Med, Paroninkuja 20, Saarentaus 04920, Finland./[Raekallio, Marja; Vainio, Outi] Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Equine & Small Anim Med, Koetilantle 2, Helsinki 00014, Finland.","Ala-Kurikka, E (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Vet Med, Dept Prod Anim Med, Res Ctr Anim Welfare, POB 57, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",NA

SIGNIFICANCE; RESIDENT MICRONEKTON; SEAMOUNT",mesopelagic layer; diel migration; physical processes,"The mesopelagic sound-scattering layer around the Hawaiian Islands undergoes diel vertical migrations. This migration also includes a significant diel horizontal onshore-offshore component. Before this study, the mechanisms underlying the horizontal movement of the mesopelagic layer had not been investigated. We took an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate relationships between the mesopelagic layer and physical oceanographic processes in the water column. The study area extended west of the leeward coast of Oahu, Hawaii. We found that the nightly inshore movement of micronekton occurs very predictably each day; onshore migration brings animals nearshore between 20:00 and 20:13 h and offshore migration commences between 03:30 and 03:45 h during the months of April and May. Simultaneous observations of nearshore physical flow and micronekton distribution indicate that the observed nightly inshore movement of micronekton in the sound-scattering layer is not directly due to physical processes in the nearshore environment. Rather, this nightly inshore movement of micronekton can be attributed primarily to micronekton swimming behavior. This behavior may be cued by changes in sunlight, but that cue is strongly mediated by a factor tied to the lunar phase, potentially moonlight. Horizontal migration velocities exceeded the maximum across-slope physical flow by 5 to 6-fold. Thus, typical across-slope flows likely represent a relatively small additional cost or benefit to onshore-off shore swimming, depending on flow direction. We suggest that energy acquisition via increased prey availability nearshore far exceeds the high energetic cost of onshore and offshore migrations.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2008,103354meps07491,"[McManus, Margaret A.; Woodson, C.

The alligators repeatedly showed shallow, inactive dives (mean depth: 0.75 m, duration: 310 s), which may represent sit-and-wait foraging for prey. The alligators also showed periodic, submerged swimming events (mean duration: 59 s, swim speed: 0.31 m s(-1), tail-beat frequency: 0.47 Hz). Based on the occurrence of diving and swimming events, and the activity level inferred from acceleration records, the animals tended to be more active during the day than at night, suggesting behavioral thermoregulation.

The behavior of amphibians presumably influences their vulnerability to mortality oil the road, but this hypothesis remains untested. We investigated the behavioral response of individuals of six species of amphibians on roads when confronted by an approaching vehicle. We first conducted a field study consisting of 50 night-driving surveys over 4 yr during which we recorded the behavior (i.e., moving, or immobile) of frogs, toads, tree frogs, and salamanders encountered oil a 20-km stretch of road. In in effort to tease apart the effects of headlights and the sound of motors on amphibian behavior, we carried out a field experiment oil a test road where we exposed individuals to different car-associated stimuli. Here, we tested the hypothesis that simultaneous exposure to headlights and the sound of a car motor would elicit a stronger response than exposure to a single stimulus or a control. Based oil the observations of the 2767 individuals in the field survey, immobility was the most common response to the approach of a car (mean probability of 0.82 of remaining immobile); the response differed across species bot depended oil the season of the survey (May-June vs. July-September). Similarly, the 91 individuals included in the field experiment were more likely to move (hiring the control treatment than during any of the car-associated treatments. The combined stimuli elicited the strongest response, followed by the headliglits-only and the motor-only treatments. Spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer) tended to move more often than the other species we tested in the field experiment, which suggests they spend less time on the road and are less vulnerable to traffic mortality than other species. Both the field survey and field experiment consistently, indicated that amphibians tend to remain immobile at the approach of a vehicle. This behavior highlights the vulnerability of amphibians to road traffic and should be considered in measures to mitigate road impacts.",ALLEN PRESS INC,DEC,2005,10165504791,"Univ Laval, Ctr Rech Biol Forestiere, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada./Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Moncton, NB E1A 3E9, Canada.","Mazerolle, MJ (reprint author), USGS, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA.",10_1655_04_79_1

Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise. Overall, 104 170 spatial positions were determined for gray triggerfish over the 42 d study. There were 27 instances of telemetered gray triggerfish responding to baited fish traps. These fish responded from initial distances up to 312 m (mean = 68 m) from traps and spent 4-95% (mean = 35%) of their time within 20 m of traps. Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait.

Although field collections have suggested that juveniles are obligate residents of the neuston, laboratory experiments on diel movements indicated the potential for downward movement during the day, when activity levels were high and active foraging would be likely. The relationship of downward movement to fish size (small vs. large juveniles), prior feeding success (high vs. low rations) and thermal structure of the water column (isothermal vs. varying intensities of thermal stratification) were tested. Thermal stratification inhibited downward movement, with sablefish displaying clear avoidance of cold water even when the thermal gradient was moderate (12 degrees C top layer and 8 degrees C bottom layer). However, sablefish could be induced to swim downward into cold water if food was introduced beneath the thermocline. Across all temperature treatments, occurrence in cold water significantly increased when food was present. Increasing the sharpness of the thermal gradient (top layer = 12 degrees C, bottom layer = 8, 6, 4 or 2 degrees C) did not affect the percentage of time spent in cold water, but did shorten the maximum time an individual would spend beneath the thermocline. Movement into cold water constituted a potentially lethal risk for juvenile sablefish; dives beneath the thermocline that exceeded 60 s resulted in loss of equilibrium and immediate death for small fish moving from 12 to 2 degrees C water. Thus, sablefish displayed behavioral trade-offs between food acquisition and the physiological risk of cold temperatures, similar to previous studies documenting balancing of foraging behavior and predation risk. Behavioral responses to thermal stratification were modified by fish size and hunger level, with larger juveniles and those held on low rations spending more time in cold water. These behavioral responses correspond with the high feeding requirements necessary to maintain the naturally rapid growth rates of this species and the transitions in habitat associated with different life history stages.

We studied moose (Alces alces) behavior relative to a road network, in an area with a history of moose-vehicle accidents, to determine when moose were crossing roadways or using areas near roads and to investigate if environmental factors were involved in this behavior. We tracked 47 adult moose with Global Positioning System collars in a study area crossed by highways and forest roads. We hypothesized that moose would avoid crossing roads but would make occasional visits to roadsides to feed on sodium-rich vegetation and avoid biting insects. Further, we expected moose avoidance to be greater for highways than forest roads. We recorded 196,710 movement segments but only observed 328 highway and 1,172 forest-road crossings (16 and 10 times lower than expected by chance). Moose usually avoided road proximity up to >= 500 in on each side but 20% of collared moose made visits to areas within 50 in of highways, which might have resulted from moose searching for sodium in vegetation and roadside salt pools. In fact, vegetation along highways had higher sodium concentrations and was browsed in similar proportions to vegetation in adjacent forest, despite moose avoidance of these zones. Moose, however, did not use areas near roads more during periods of biting insect abundance. Our results supported the hypothesis of scale-dependent selection by moose; avoidance of highways at a coarse scale may confer long-term benefits, whereas selection of highway corridors at finer scales may be part of a strategy to overcome short-term limiting factors such as sodium deficiency. We found a positive relationship between home-range size and the proportion of road axes they contained, Suggesting that moose either compensated for habitat loss or made specific movements along highways to gather sodium. The presence of sodium along highways likely increases moose-vehicle accident risks. Removal of salt pools or use of a de-icing salt other than sodium chloride should render highway surroundings less attractive to moose.",WILDLIFE SOC,SEP,2008,1021932008063,"[Laurian, Catherine; Ouellet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Dept Biol Chim & Giog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Dussault, Christian; Breton, Laurier] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune Quebec, Direct Rech Faune, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4X4, Canada./[Courtois, Rehaume] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune Quebec, Direct Dev Faune, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4X4, Canada./[Poulin, Marius] Minist Transports Quebec, Direct Gen Quebec & Est Quebec, Quebec City, PQ G2K 1M1, Canada.","Laurian, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Dept Biol Chim & Giog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",NA

A total of 1,446 usable headings, 1,275 MNND, and 1,359 behavior state data points were used to calculate response variables of reorientation, splitting-joining, and behavior state transition rates relative to explanatory variables using standard multiplelinear-regression, logistic regression, or multinomial logistic regression models. Reorientation rates tended to be higher when other species were present. No explanatory variables were found to influence the splitting-joining rate. Risso's behavior state was significantly affected by calf presence and time of day. Risso's groups spent most (60%) time engaged in rest/slow travel followed by mf travel (33%) and milling (7%), and rarely changed behavior state. Transitions from one behavior state to another were more common in groups with calf presence, which were 4.3 times more likely to continue mf travel than non-calf groups. During early afternoon, Risso's were six times more likely to continue mf travel versus early morning and late afternoon. Preponderance of daytime rest/slow travel likely reflects presumed need for diurnal rest prior to apparent nocturnal foraging, a pattern associated with other nocturnal foraging dolphin species.

pattern; confusion effect","The schooling of fishes is one typical animal social behavior. One primary function of fish school is to protect members when attacked by predators. One main way that the school reduces the predator's chance of making a successful kill is to confuse the predator as it makes its strike. This may be accomplished by collective evasion behaviors organized through integration of motions of individual fish made based on their innate actions (behavior patterns). In order to investigate what kind of behavior pattern of individuals can generate the efficient collective evasion of a school, we present a model of evasion behavior pattern which consists of three component behavior patterns, schooling, cooperative escape, and selfish escape behavior patterns and the rule for choice of one among them with proper timing. Each fish determines its movement direction taking into account simultaneously three kinds of elemental motions, mimicking its neighbors, avoiding collisions with its nearest neighbors, and escaping from an approaching predator. The weights of three elemental motions are changed depending on which component behavior pattern the fish carries out. The values of the weights for three component behavior patterns can be definitively determined under the condition that the collective evasion of the school becomes the most efficient, that is, the probability that any member is eaten by the predator becomes minimum.

The combination of seed retention times (mean 39.5 h, maximum 114 h) and elephant displacement rates (average 1988 m in 116 hours) resulted in 50% of seeds dispersed over 1.2 km (mean 1222-2105 m, maximum 5772 m). Shifts in diet composition did not affect gut retention time and germination of ingested seeds. Elephant displacements were slightly longer, with stronger seasonal variation in Myanmar. As a consequence, seed dispersal curves varied seasonally with longer distances during the dry season in Myanmar but not in Sri Lanka.

We quantified the effect of habitat and biotic and individual factors on space use by amphibians ( Bufo bufo spinosus [ BB] and Bufo viridis [BV]) that were radio-tracked in their terrestrial summer habitat. We analyzed two spatial scales, 50% core areas and 95% home ranges ( excluding 50% core areas), thought to represent resting and foraging areas, respectively. The 50% core area of BB was best explained by habitat structure and prey density, whereas the 50% core area of BV was determined solely by habitat structure. This suggests that the resting and foraging areas of BB are not spatially separated. The 95% home range of BB was determined by prey density, while for BV both habitat structure and prey density determined home range size. We conclude that the terrestrial area requirements of amphibians depend on the productivity and spatiotemporal complexity of landscapes and that differential space use may facilitate their co-occurrence. Behavior-based a priori hypotheses, in combination with an information-theoretic approach and path analyses, provide a promising framework to disentangle factors that govern individual space use, thereby advancing home range studies.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,JAN,2009,101086593355,"[Indermaur, Lukas; Gehring, Marianne; Wehrle, Wendelin] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland./[Indermaur, Lukas; Gehring, Marianne; Wehrle, Wendelin] ETH, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland./[Tockner, Klement] Leibnitz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany./[Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-1000 Berlin, Germany./[Naef-Daenzer, Beat] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6203 Sempach, Switzerland.","Indermaur, L (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",10_1086_593355

We studied three crested macaque groups, ranging in size from 50 to 97 individuals, for 18 months in the Tangkoko-DuaSudara Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi. They spent 59% of the day moving and procuring food, especially fruits, and 41% of the day resting and socializing. Their diet is composed of more than 145 species of fruit (66% of observed feeding bouts), vegetative material (2.5%), invertebrates (31.5%), and occasional vertebrate prey. Group differences were more pronounced than seasonal or diurnal differences. Specifically, the largest group moved farther during the day, moved at a faster and more uniform rate, ate less fruit, rested more, and socialized less than the smaller groups did. The largest group had the largest home range, but it included less primary forest and more disturbed habitat than the ranges of smaller groups. There are individual differences in activity budgets of adult males and females in time spent moving, resting, Seeding, and socializing that may reflect differences in reproductive strategies of males versus females. The behavior of large juveniles is more similar to that of adults than to that of small juveniles. Daily movements and use of home range are correlated with diet. Macaques moved shorter distances as the proportion of time spent feeding on fruit increased, and the top four dietary items accounted for most of the variance in entry into hectare blocks of home range.",PLENUM PUBL CORP,JUN,1997,101023A1026330332061,"WILDLIFE CONSERVAT SOC,INDONESIA PROGRAM,BRONX,NY 10460.",NA,NA

Although an increasing number of Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) pups are admitted to rehabilitation centers, few studies have been conducted to monitor the behaviors and survival of rehabilitated pups released back into the wild. Our objectives were to compare diving behaviors, activity patterns, movements, and survival between rehabilitated pups (n = 29) and wild pups (n = 24). Pups were radiotracked for 5 months after release at Pebble Beach, California, during 1995, 1996, and 1998. Mean duration of dives (t(27) = 0.90, P = 0.37) and surface intervals (U = 52, P = 0.20) of rehabilitated pups did not differ from that of wild pups. Rehabilitated pups spent a greater proportion of their time in the water (t(18) = 2.12, P = 0.047) than did wild pups. Most pups traveled north from Pebble Beach, and movements were variable. Seal group (F-1,F- 31 = 1.33, P = 0.26) or sex (F-1,F- 31 = 0.22, P = 0,64) had no effect on maximum distance traveled. Survival curves between rehabilitated and wild pups were similar during 1995 (chi(2) = 0.40, P > 0.05) and 1998 (chi(2) = 1.34, P > 0.05), whereas rehabilitated pups had lower survival than wild pups during 1996 (chi(2) = 3.94, P < 0.05). Survival curves between wild and rehabilitated pups were similar after pooling data across years within each group (&chi;(2) = 2.91, P > 0.05).

Probability of a blade strike is affected by the rates at which a bird visits the rotor swept zone (RSZ), and mitigated by the behaviors it uses to avoid being struck. Between 2011 and 2013, we studied the occurrence and nature of avoidance responses of 3 nesting ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis), 5 Swainson's hawks (B. swainsoni), and 2 red-tailed hawks (B. jamaicensis) to turbines built within their territories. Two of 10 breeding males we tracked with satellite telemetry were turbine-collision fatalities, one during the study and the other in the following year. Collectively, nesting hawks displayed no macro-avoidance of turbine projects and flew adjacent to or within RSZs at high rates ((x) over bar = 0.8 visits/hr, 1.3 min/visit; n = 387 visits during 434 hr of observation) synchronized with morning and afternoon peaks in foraging activity. Passes through rotors accounted for 9.8% of responses. The turbine that hawks approached most closely from collective encounters on each territory accounted for an average of 29% of all visits to RSZs and visitation was greater than expected at turbines <0.8 km from nests (P < 0.001). As rotor speed increased, the frequency that hawks in RSZs flew between turbine rows increased relative to other avoidance behaviors and hawks that were potentially distracted (i.e., hunting or aggressive chasing) increased avoidance flights over and between turbines. The ability of hawks to employ evasive behaviors mitigated blade collision but allowed for close, hourly interaction with turbines that increased risk of collision. Where nesting populations of hawks are at risk, particularly ferruginous hawks, pre-construction siting of wind turbines needs to account for nest locations and expected high rates of hawk visitation to turbines <800 m from nests. On existing projects collision risk can be reduced through operational shutdown of turbines in this zone during 2 daily peaks in hawk foraging in the vicinity where hawks nest, but a greater effectiveness can be achieved by shutdown of specific turbines associated with highest regular use.

To persist in human proximity, while avoiding conflict and mortality, they must make adjustments in their spatial behavior. Understanding such behavioral adaptations can be crucial to formulate conservation strategies. We used GPS location data to study the movement and space use of protected Arabian wolves in the extremely arid Negev Desert (Israel), where natural prey densities are reduced. We examined wolf preference for the proximity of human infrastructure, while testing the hypothesis that wolves would use areas where ungulates were more likely to occur. Wolves showed a strong spatial association with humans, spending a large proportion of their time in proximity of human infrastructure and moving primarily along roads. Wolves also increased their movement during the night. In addition, wolves that had higher availability of human infrastructure in their home ranges showed increased selection for such features, suggesting a positive functional response. Finally, wolves did not show preference for areas of high ungulate occurrence at either spatial scale. These findings, combined with recent diet analyses, indicate that wolves rely on human subsidies, proportioned by the availability of garbage and agricultural produce. Our results demonstrate that wolves fine-tune their space use to persist in the vicinity of humans. Additional conditions that enable such persistence include effective legal protection and positive local attitudes toward wolves. We conclude that such circumstances can promote spatial coexistence of humans and large carnivores. The strong observed spatial association and evident dietary dependence of wolves on subsidies from a low-density human population may also reflect the conditions that led to dog domestication.",WILEY,OCT,2018,101111acv12414,"[Barocas, A.] San Diego Zoos, Inst Conservat Res, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA./[Barocas, A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Abingdon, Oxon, England./[Hefner, R.] Israel Nat & Pk Author, Beer Sheva, Israel./[Ucko, M.] Natl Ctr Mariculture, Israel Oceanog & Limnol Res Inst, Elat, Israel./[Merkle, J.

In Quebec (Canada), sodium is readily available in aquatic vegetation and in salt pools that form along highways. We do not know if moose are adopting specific behaviors to access sodium sources or if they simply use the sodium sources they encounter during their movements. We tested the hypothesis that moose modify both space and habitat use to gather sodium from salt pools. We expected moose to use salt pools mostly in spring and early summer, when needs are greatest and before aquatic vegetation has fully developed. We fitted 47 moose with Global Positioning System telemetry collars and collected data for 2 to 36 months between 2003 and 2006. We rarely located moose at salt pools (0.12% among the 95,007 locations collected). As we expected, use of salt pools was highest in late spring and in early summer, and we observed a time lag between peak use of salt pools compared to use of lakes and waterways, indicating moose fulfilled their sodium requirements in salt pools before aquatic vegetation was available. Moose selected salt pools over lakes and waterways when these 2 sodium sources were present in their home range and moved rapidly over large distances to reach them. Our results were consistent with moose using salt pools when they are likely to be sodium deficient. Salt pools were less accessible, required long-distance movements, and were located in habitually avoided areas along highways. Elimination of roadside salt pools should be considered among strategies to reduce cervid-vehicle collision risks in boreal environments.",WILEY,JUL,2008,1021932007504,"[Laurian, Catherine; Ouellet, Jean-Pierre] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Dussault, Christian; Courtois, Rehaume; Breton, Laurier] Minist Ressources Nat & Faune Quebec, Direct Rech Faune, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4X4, Canada./[Poulin, Marius] Minist Transports Quebec, Direct Generale Quebec & Est Quebec, Quebec City, PQ G2K 1M1, Canada.","Laurian, C (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Dept Biol Chim & Geog, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",NA

Exploration of observed route choice behavior is crucial because the underlying decision-making process is more complex and dynamic for route choice than for other travel choice dimensions. Furthermore, the difficulties associated with collection of data on route choice are reflected in the scarcity of studies on observed behavior and the major simplifications made in traffic assignment models developed for the most common commercial software. The present study analyzes a GPS-based database of 679 routes, collected by a personal probe system called the activity locator over a period of 2 weeks for a sample of 12 students from the University of Cagliari in Italy. In particular, variability in the daily route (for the same individual and for several individuals) and observed deviations of the route from minimum-cost routes have been examined in depth. The results indicate that higher levels of intraindividual variability are found for discretionary trips, whereas higher levels of interindividual variability, as well as greater deviation from minimum-cost routes, are associated with work or study trips.",NATL ACAD SCIENCES,NA,2011,103141223011,"[Spissu, Erika; Meloni, Italo; Sanjust, Benedetta] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Ingn Terr, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.","Spissu, E (reprint author), Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Ingn Terr, Via San Giorgio 12, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",NA

Distinguishing behavioral from demographic responses to environmental variability has important implications for interpretation of spatial patterns and projections of population persistence. I studied the behavioral and demographic responses of tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, to experimental variation in the density of breeding ponds over two years. At natural spatiotemporal scales of variation in pond density, behavioral responses predominated over demographic responses. In the first year of the experiment, when plots varied in pond density, tungara frogs were proportionally more abundant in plots that contained higher densities of ponds. This behavioral response appeared to be due to increased ability to find plots with high pond densities and reduced effects of pond saturation (i.e., availability of unused ponds) within these plots. In the second year of the experiment, when plots had equal pond densities, there was a detectable demographic response to breeding-pond density early in the season, with fewer frogs in plots that had contained no ponds in the previous year. This response was short-lived, however, and by the end of the second year there was no detectable demographic effect. These results demonstrate that behavioral responses may predominate over demographic responses even on relatively large scales. Thus, studies demonstrating changes in patterns of abundance and distribution must be cautious in interpreting these results in the context of metapopulation dynamics without a detailed understanding of species-specific dispersal behavior.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,MAY,2001,1023072679989,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA./Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","Marsh, DM (reprint author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24550 USA.",NA

The topics were abortion, affirmative action, death penalty, and euthanasia. Behavior data were determined from audio recordings where each second of the conversation was assessed as proself, neutral, or prosocial. We determined the probability density function of the durations of time spent in each behavioral state. These durations were well fit by a stretched exponential distribution, exp(kt(-a)) with an exponent, a, of approximately 0.3. This indicates that the switching between behavioral states is not a random Markov process, but one where the probability to switch behavioral states decreases with the time already spent in that behavioral state. The degree of this ""memory"" was stronger in those groups who did not reach a consensus and where the conflict grew more destructive than in those that did. Emotion data were measured by having each person listen to the audio recording and moving a computer mouse to recall their negative or positive emotional valence at each moment in the conversation. We used the Hurst rescaled range analysis and power spectrum to determine the correlations in the fluctuations of the emotional valence. The emotional valence was well described by a random walk whose increments were uncorrelated. Thus, the behavior data demonstrated a ""memory"" of the duration already spent in a behavioral state while the emotion data fluctuated as a random walk whose steps did not have a ""memory"" of previous steps.

We compared these opposing explanations of foraging time allocation in a coral reef fish, bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum). Aggregations of juvenile bluehead wrasse experience safety-in-numbers, and preliminary observations suggested that juveniles in aggregations spent more time foraging for copepods in the water column than solitary juveniles. However, the risk reduction and resource competition hypotheses are indistinguishable on the basis of behavioral observations alone. Therefore, we collected behavioral, dietary, and growth data (using otolith growth rings) for bluehead wrasse at multiple reefs around a Caribbean island. Despite spending more time foraging in the water column, grouped fish did not capture more prey items and had slower growth rates than solitary fish. Thus, the increased foraging time of grouped fish appears to reflect resource competition, not risk reduction. This competition may limit the size and frequency of aggregations among juvenile bluehead wrasse, which have been shown to experience reduced mortality rates in larger groups. Bluehead wrasse recruits also spent less time foraging but grew faster at sites where planktonic copepod prey were more abundant. This suggests the possibility that large-scale spatiotemporal variability in the abundance of planktonic copepods over coral reefs may produce corresponding variability in the dynamics of reef fish populations.",SPRINGER,NOV,2007,101007s0044200708384,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA./Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","White, JW (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",10_1007_s00442_007_0838_4

Radio telemetry of 25 adult snakes over two active seasons revealed that, as disturbance increased, gravid females were less visible to observers, but the visibility of non-gravid females and males did not change.

We combined remote biologger technology, capturing continuous heart rate values, with locational data from GPS collars to investigate the behavioral and physiological reactions of American black bears (Ursus americanus) to a landscape dominated by agriculture (52.5% areal cover). Our study occurred at the edge of the range of this species, with small, scattered patches of forest within a mosaic of crop fields and an extensive road network. However, only; similar to 2-4% of the area contained crops that bears consumed (corn, sunflowers, oats). We used GPS locations to identify the habitat that bears occupied, and to estimate their rates of travel. Heart rates increased with movement rates, rising by over 30% from resting rate to their fastest travel speeds. We used a modeling approach to distinguish among factors that influenced heart rates independent of movement rates. Bears commonly crossed agricultural areas that provided no food or cover and their heart rates, elevated beyond what was expected from their movement rate, were indicative of a stress response. However, when bears entered agricultural areas composed of edible crops, many individuals showed reduced movement and slower heart rates, suggesting that bears foraging there felt at ease or crops allow bears to more easily forage due to their dense spatial arrangements. Unexpectedly, female bears elicited lower heart rates and lower levels of activity in the most fragmented patches of natural habitat, possibly a sign of human-avoidance behavior or a reaction related to crossing roads. During fall, as bears prepared for hibernation, their heart rates declined two weeks before their movements slackened, evidence that metabolism slowed to enhance fat accumulation; they also shifted to a nocturnal activity pattern, likely to reduce exertion during the heat of the day. The use of a physiological monitor provided new insights on bear biology and ecology that would not have otherwise been apparent.",ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,MAR,2015,101890ES14001991,"[Ditmer, M.

Tag- and capture-induced effects on individual behavior, survival and reproduction may limit extrapolation of transmitter data to wider populations. However, measuring individual responses to capture and tagging is a necessary step in developing research techniques that minimize negative effects. We measured the short-term behavioral effects of handling and GPS transmitter attachment on Brown Pelicans under both captive and field conditions, and followed tagged individuals through a full breeding season to assess whether capture and transmitter attachment increased rates of nest abandonment or breeding failure. We observed slight increases in preening among tagged individuals 0-2 h after capture relative to controls that had not been captured or tagged, with a corresponding reduction in time spent resting. One to three days post-capture, nesting behavior of tagged pelicans resembled that of neighbors that had not been captured or tagged. Eighty-eight percent of tagged breeders remained at the same nest location for more than 48 h after capture, attending nests and chicks for an average of 49 days, and 51% were assumed to successfully fledge young. Breeding success was driven primarily by variation in location; however, sex and handling time also influenced the probability of successful breeding in tagged pelicans, suggesting that individual characteristics and the capture process itself can confound the effects of capture and transmitter attachment. We conclude that pelicans fitted with GPS transmitters exhibit comparable behaviors to untagged individuals within a day of capture and that GPS tracking is a viable technique for studying behavior and demography in this species. We also identify measures to minimize post-capture nest abandonment rates in tracking studies, including minimizing handling time and covering nests during processing.",NA,APR,2017,101007s1033601614183,NA,NA,10_1007_s10336_016_1418_3

Movement patterns of animals can vary dramatically as a function of their reproductive cycle or social structure; however, little is known about how changes in the social structure of dispersers affect patterns of seed dispersal. We examined the movement patterns of the forest-dwelling and cooperatively breeding Puff-throated Bulbul (Alophoixus pallidus) in relation to different stages of their reproductive cycle, time of day, and group size, to determine potential impacts on the shape and scale of dispersal curves generated using a combination of gut passage time and displacement distance data. There were significant differences in dispersal distances depending on group size, season (breeding, non-breeding), incubation (vs. other times of the year), and time of the day. The estimated median seed dispersal distance was 28 m. The median dispersal distances produced by birds in larger groups were longer than those of smaller groups (29 m vs. 25 m). During the breeding season, median dispersal distances were longer than during the non-breeding season (31 m vs. 25 m), but the median dispersal distances were significantly shorter during incubation than during outside incubation (24 m vs. 28 m). The median dispersal distance produced in the early morning (30 m) was also longer than that of other times of the day (23 m late morning, 28 m early afternoon, and 26 m late afternoon). This study suggests that various aspects of an animal's behavior are likely to have significant effects on seed shadows and that this may vary significantly even among individuals of the same species.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,MAY,2014,101111btp12100,"[Khamcha, Daphawan; Savini, Tommaso; Gale, George A.] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Bioresources & Technol, Conservat Ecol Program, Bangkok 10150, Thailand./[Westcott, David A.; McKeown, Adam] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci Atherton, Atherton, Qld 4883, Australia./[Brockelman, Warren Y.] Bioresources Technol Unit, Ecol Lab, Khlongluang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand./[Chimchome, Vijak] Kasetsart Univ, Dept Forest Biol, Fac Forestry, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.","Khamcha, D (reprint author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Bioresources & Technol, Conservat Ecol Program, 49 Bangkhuntien Chaithalay Rd, Bangkok 10150, Thailand.",NA

This study examined the potential for bulls to be controlled during mating using mild electric shocks delivered through radio-controlled collars. Eighteen Belmont Red bulls were fitted with collars containing the Global Positioning System and that were able to emit a mild electric shock (500 mW) at the top of the neck behind the poll. Eighteen Belmont Red cows were fitted with Global Positioning System collars only. The experiment was replicated 3 times in 3 paddocks. Each paddock contained 2 bulls and 1 cow in induced estrus. On d 1, the bulls were either assigned to the cow or not assigned to the cow, and on d 2, the assignments were reversed, and bulls received the other treatment using a new cow. Treatments were applied for 2 h on each day. The nonassigned bull received a mild electric shock on approach to either the cow or to a bull, whereas the assigned bull received a mild electric shock on approach to the other bull only. The electric shock was applied when the bulls were within approximately 10 m and moving toward the nonallowed animal. The electric shock was terminated when the animal responded by stopping movement toward the nonallowed animal. In the first 10 min, nonassigned bulls spent less time within 5 m of the cow (P = 0.03) than assigned bulls. Assigned bulls spent more time close to the cow during the entire 120 min on d 1 than on d 2 (P = 0.014). On d 1, the assigned bulls moved more toward the cow and the nonassigned bull than they did on d 2 (P = 0.02). Assigned bulls displayed more sexual behaviors than nonassigned bulls (P = 0.004). Nonassigned bulls were sometimes observed not to approach the cow despite a change in its location. This suggests that the bull associated the electric shock with the cow and not with the location in which it received the electric shock. Instances were observed in which the cow pursued the nonassigned bull, in which case the bull did not receive an electric shock, and this may reflect the preference of the cow. This study demonstrated that bulls can be separated and prevented from approaching a cow in estrus using a mild electric shock. However, mate allocation was not completely successful due to the potential for cow preference for certain bulls.",AMER SOC ANIMAL SCIENCE,JUL,2008,102527jas20070647,"[Lee, C.; Fisher, A.

Such extreme weather events are known to have severe effects across trophic levels, for instance, causing die-offs of large herbivores. However, the extent to which individuals and populations are able to buffer such events through behavioral plasticity is poorly understood. Here, we analyze responses in space use to rain-on-snow and icing events, and their fitness correlates, in wild reindeer in high-Arctic Svalbard. Range displacement among GPS-collared females occurred mainly in icy winters to areas with less ice, lower over-winter body mass loss, lower mortality rate, and higher subsequent fecundity, than the departure area. Our study provides rare empirical evidence that mammals may buffer negative effects of climate change and extreme weather events by adjusting behavior in highly stochastic environments.

A functionally identified statocyst-driven interneuron that directionally responded to body tilting without a footboard and to tilting of the footboard was found to show complicated responses depending upon the ongoing behavior of the animal when it freely walked around in water on the aquarium floor. The spike firing frequency of the interneuron increased significantly during walking. When the animal stood or walked on the tilted floor, the interneuron activity represented the tilt angle and direction if the abdomen was actively flexed, but not if it was extended. Two other statocyst-driven descending interneurons were found to be affected differently by the animal's behavioral condition: the spike activity of one interneuron increased during walking, but its directional response on the tilted floor was completely absent during abdominal posture movements, whereas that of another interneuron was enhanced during abdominal extension only, representing the tilt angle and direction.

Habitat features are useful in predicting the postfledging movements of ovenbirds.

Digestion of large prey is metabolically and aerobically costly, and large prey boluses can impair snake locomotion, increasing vulnerability to predation. Cessation of foraging and use of refugia with microclimates facilitating digestion are expected to be strategies employed by free-ranging snakes to cope with the demands of digestion while minimizing risk of predation. However, empirical observations of such submergent behavior from field experiments are limited. The brown treesnake (Serpentes: Colubridae: Boiga irregularis) is a nocturnal, arboreal, colubrid snake that was accidentally introduced to the island of Guam, with ecologically and economically costly consequences. Because tools for brown treesnake damage prevention generally rely on snakes being visible or responding to lures or baits while foraging, cessation of foraging activities after feeding would complicate management. We sought to characterize differences in brown treesnake activity, movement, habitat use, and detectability following feeding of large meals (rodents 33% of the snake's unfed body mass) via radio telemetry, trapping, and visual surveys. Compared to unfed snakes, snakes in the feeding treatment group showed drastic decreases in hourly and nightly activity rates, differences in refuge height and microhabitat type, and a marked decrease in detectability by trapping and visual surveys. Depression of activity lasted approximately 5-7 days, a period that corresponds to previous studies of brown treesnake digestion and cycles of detectability. Our results indicate that management strategies for invasive brown treesnakes need to account for cycles of unavailability and underscore the importance of preventing spread of brown treesnakes to new environments where large prey are abundant and periods of cryptic behavior are likely to be frequent.

Spatio-temporal distribution of both animals and cotton balls was automatically recorded by RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification Device) technique. Our results revealed a behavioral differentiation during a collective building task. In a group of six individuals, only two mice (called carriers) transported 80% of the building material whereas the contribution of the remaining mice was weak or even non-existent. The proportion of carriers was constant in all of the six groups studied. This behavioral differentiation was implemented immediately after the building material was made available and remained stable during the 4 days of experiment.

Some organisms roost together in different locations each night (or day), whereas others roost in traditional locations each night, sometimes switching between roosts in the roost network. The behaviors that drive roost-site selection and the resulting patterns are not well understood. We created an individual-based model that simulates the daily aggregation of organisms into communal roosts. In the model, individuals move according to a movement rule integrating 2 independently adjustable behavioral drivers: roost fidelity, which leads individuals back toward their previous nights' roost, and conspecific attraction, which leads individuals to congregate toward nearest conspecific neighbors. The model predicts that variable levels of aggregation will emerge under different combinations of these drivers, ranging from no aggregation to complete aggregation of individuals into their previous roosts. We tested to see which combination of drivers best predicts patterns of roost use in our study system of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southeastern Louisiana in fall. Using Doppler weather radar data, we show that Tree Swallow roost sites remain consistent from night to night, and the birds return to one of several traditional roosts. Using radio telemetry, we show that individuals switch between these traditional roosts at minimum 22% of the time. Our results suggest that the formation of large communal roosts in Tree Swallows is driven by a combination of moderate conspecific attraction and strong, but not perfect, roost fidelity.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,JUL-AUG,2014,101093behecoaru044,"[Laughlin, Andrew J.; Taylor, Caz M.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA./[Sheldon, Daniel R.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Comp Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA./[Winkler, David W.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA./[Winkler, David W.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.","Laughlin, AJ (reprint author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 400 Lindy Boggs,6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",NA

However, the mechanistic basis for facultative scavenging remains poorly understood. The co-occurrence of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Raine Island (Australia), provides an opportunity to examine a top marine predator's feeding mode in response to seasonal pulses in nesting turtles that offer both hunting and scavenging opportunities. Using satellite telemetry, we evaluated home range overlap between sharks and turtles and quantified their surfacing behavior around Raine Island during the turtle nesting season. We found core home range overlap to be highest during the nesting season. Both sharks and turtles spent significantly more time at the surface in areas of greatest range overlap closest to shore, where turtle density was highest. Both sharks and turtles showed decreased surfacing with increasing distance from Raine Island. Combined with published data on turtle demography at Raine Island, we propose the following: (1) sharks patrol the surface to increase scavenging opportunities on turtle carcasses and intercept weakened individuals after nesting; (2) healthy turtles may not perceive sharks as a major threat and/or other biological factors override anti-predatory responses; and (3) sharks during the nesting season may primarily scavenge on dead turtles individuals rather than actively hunt. Our study results and approach may be applicable to other situations in which direct observations of predator-prey interactions are limited.
Every animal encounters dead or dying resources, yet the role of facultative scavenging has been difficult to study, and thus largely overlooked in marine behavioral ecological research. Movement analyses of tiger shark and green turtle movement and surfacing behavior at Raine Island (Australia) suggest that facultative scavenging may be a prevalent, yet underappreciated, feeding strategy in tiger sharks. Our integration of behavioral ecology theory with multi-species electronic tagging provided a valuable approach for investigating predator-prey interactions in situations where direct observations are limited or not possible.",SPRINGER,OCT,2016,101007s0026501621832,"[Hammerschlag, Neil; Gallagher, Austin J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA./[Hammerschlag, Neil; Gallagher, Austin J.] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA./[Bell, Ian] Queensland Dept Environm & Heritage Protect, Townsville, Qld, Australia./[Fitzpatrick, Richard; Barnett, Adam] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia./[Gallagher, Austin J.] Beneath Waves Inc, Syracuse, NY USA./[Hawkes, Lucy A.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, Cornwall, England./[Meekan, Mark G.; Thums, Michele] UWA Oceans Inst, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia./[Stevens, John D.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia./[Witt, Matthew J.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, Cornwall, England./[Barnett, Adam] James Cook Univ, TropWATER Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res, Townsville, Qld, Australia.","Hammerschlag, N (reprint author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.; Hammerschlag, N (reprint author), Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",10_1007_s00265_016_2183_2

Here, the idea of behavioral intermittence is shown to be crucial to establish mechanistic connections between the behavior of organisms and the statistical properties they generate when moving. Attention is drawn to the fact that some random walk modeling procedures can impair the identification of intermittent biological mechanisms which could govern major statistical properties of movement. This fact, together with some misconceptions and prejudices regarding the role of randomness in animal motion may explain why stochastic processes have been disregarded as a potential source of adaptation in animal movement.

Boyce, Mark S.",NA,NA,NA,"In seasonally varying environments, animals should alter habitat selection through time to avoid the harshest conditions. Winter severity is limiting for many ungulates in high-latitude ecosystems, and quality of habitat is an important determinant of winter survival. Previous studies in Southeast Alaska indicated that Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) selected old-growth forest that provides both snow interception and forage, but with great variability among studies, years, and geographic areas. Clearcut timber harvest has greatly reduced the extent and quality of old-growth forest. The value of 2nd-growth and old-growth forest types to deer likely depends on snow depth, which is highly variable in space and time. We measured selection for vegetation classes, landscape features, and forage biomass by monitoring 56 GPS-radiocollared adult female deer from 1 January to 1 April between 2011 and 2013. Simultaneously, we measured snow depth across deer home ranges daily. We determined that snow depth had a strong effect on selection for vegetation classes. During periods of low snow, deer selected young 2nd growth but avoided old 2nd growth and high-volume old growth. As snow depths increased, young 2nd growth was avoided and deer selected old 2nd-growth and productive old-growth forests. The composition of vegetation classes within the landscape influenced selection, with deer selecting locally abundant habitats. These behaviors suggest that the widespread distribution of forest patches that provide snow interception and forage biomass may be critical to fulfilling the energetic requirements of deer during winters with snow. Such context-dependent habitat selection is likely widespread among wildlife species in variable environments and should be incorporated into study design and analysis.",NA,FEB,2017,101093jmammalgyw167,NA,NA,NA

Recent work has highlighted the importance of the ambient soundscape in providing orientation cues for larvae of coral reef fishes at the key life-history phase when they recruit from open ocean to coral reef environments. In this study, we combined acoustic conditioning with binary choice chambers and used 442 settlement-stage larvae from 4 Pomacentridae (damselfish) species (Pomacentrus amboinensis, P. brachialis, P. moluccensis, and P. nagasakiensis) to test whether responses to acoustic cues are fixed or whether behavior is influenced by recent acoustic experience. Over 8 trials, groups of wild-caught larvae that experienced noise (natural reef noise or artificial tone noise) during a 12-h conditioning period showed a positive directional response to reef noise in the chambers. Groups conditioned with reef noise responded adversely to the tone noise, whereas groups conditioned to the artificial tones were subsequently attracted by them. This plasticity in behavior suggests that settlement-stage larval reef fish (similar to 20 days old) are influenced by, and can retain information from, recent acoustic experiences. Behavioral plasticity may enable greater control by larvae over their selection of settlement sites but could also mean that anthropogenic sounds have more than masking effects on the orientation behavior of fishes.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,SEP-OCT,2010,101093behecoarq117,"[Simpson, Stephen D.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Midlothian, Scotland./[Meekan, Mark G.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst MO96, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia./[McCauley, Robert D.] Curtin Univ Technol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Perth, WA 6845, Australia./[Jeffs, Andrew] Univ Auckland, Dept Marine Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand.","Simpson, SD (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1UG, Avon, England.",NA

Such plasticity may be especially important for long-lived and wide-ranging species, such as parrots, that likely face great temporal and spatial variation within their long lifespans, and are often disproportionately affected by anthropogenic habitat change. We used radio-telemetry and roost counts to assess ranging patterns, habitat usage, and roosting behaviors of the Yellow-naped Amazon (Amazona auropalliata) at two sites in northern Costa Rica with different degrees of anthropogenic habitat alteration. We compared behaviors for residents at the two sites and for experimentally translocated individuals to test the hypothesis that this species would employ behavioral plasticity in response to habitat differences. We found that individuals in the region with dispersed vegetation recorded ranging movements and communal roosting behavior ten times larger than the region with concentrated vegetation. Translocated individuals showed flexibility in these behaviors and matched the behavioral patterns of resident birds at the release site rather than maintaining behaviors characteristic of their capture site. Our results illustrate a generalized rapid plastic response to human-induced changes in habitat for a number of behavioral traits in the Yellow-naped Amazon. Such plasticity is directly relevant to reintroduction efforts that are commonly employed as a conservation tool in parrots. Our study provides an example of how behavioral plasticity may allow some wild populations to withstand anthropogenic change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As in the LD box, animals which spend less time and are less active in the brightly illuminated section of the maze are considered to have higher anxiety levels. In the tunnel maze, the LAL mice showed more exploration and spent more time in the central arena than the SAL animals, but only during the final 2 min of the 6-min test. This reduced preference for the central arena was not due to general inactivity or a failure of the SAL to find the central arena and indicates a higher level of state anxiety in the aggressive animals.

However, while the foraging behavior of active foragers has been extensively studied, only little is known about that of sit-and-wait predators within the personality framework. We investigated the existence of repeatability and personality in pit-building antlion larvae in the context of foraging (pit construction) and habitat selection (relocation distance and direction) over time and under three environmental contexts: thermal conditions, sand depth, and soil type. Over time, repeatability was much stronger for relocation distance than for movement directionality. Additionally, we observed positive correlations across the two levels of sand depth and soil type but not between thermal conditions. Change in substrate type may induce faster decision-making in these sand-dwelling insects or could be perceived by such insects as a more drastic alteration in their habitat. We suggest that different individuals indeed possess distinct personalities. We also suggest that repeatability should be measured at two levels: the amount of energy expenditure (distances and pit construction) and the pattern of energy expenditure (directionality). Finally, our study illustrates how differing environmental conditions can result in differing levels of plasticity, while largely preserving individual personalities.",SPRINGER,DEC,2014,101007s002650141804x,"[Alcalay, Yehonatan; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel./[Scharf, Inon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","Alcalay, Y (reprint author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",10_1007_s00265_014_1804_x

We examined here the behavioral repeatability of two activity-related traits: movement and edge preference (proportion of time spent next to the test arena edge). We used the red flour beetle as our test species in order to determine whether repeatability changes throughout metamorphosis and aging and whether there are inter-sexual differences. Young adults moved more than larvae, but movement activity generally declined with age. Behavioral repeatability was high between two successive measurements for larvae and young adults, but did not persist through metamorphosis. These findings support most of the previous studies on insects and probably reflect the occurrence of phenotypic reorganization during metamorphosis. Neither of our predictions of an increase in behavioral repeatability throughout aging and of a higher repeatability of young adults than larvae held true, as repeatability levels estimates remained similar across ontogeny and aging. Similar to other studies on repeatability, estimates declined with the time interval between two pairs of measurements, suggesting an episodic physiological basis for the documented behaviors. Finally, we detected several inter-sexual differences. Females were more active than males and expressed a shallower decline in movement with aging. Female movement activity was also more repeatable, but female edge preference was less repeatable than that of males. We reason that such differences in repeatability may be driven by sex-specific selection pressures on behavioral tendencies.
We investigate several questions regarding behavioral repeatability in insects. The two main questions asked are (1) whether inter-individual behavioral differences remain consistent across larvae and adult stage, and (2) how repeatability changes throughout aging. The first question has been only rarely tested in insects that undergo a full metamorphosis. It has been recognized as a timely question and as an opportunity for researchers studying animal personality. Previous results regarding amphibians and insects that undergo partial metamorphosis were inconclusive. The second question is important, because studies rarely follow individuals throughout their lives. This is essential to understand the consequences of aging. We also report on differences between males and females, probably indicating on differences in motivation for activity and in patterns of aging. Finally, the question, how behavior changes with ontogeny, has been already recognized by Tinbergen as a basic one in animal behavior.",SPRINGER,MAY,2016,101007s002650162098y,"[Wexler, Yonatan; Subach, Aziz; Scharf, Inon] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel./[Pruitt, Jonathan N.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","Scharf, I (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",10_1007_s00265_016_2098_y

From 1996-1998, we identified factors influencing the immediate response of free-ranging plains bison (B. b. bison) to human presence, evaluated whether human disturbance increased their daily movements, and determined whether this influenced resource use in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan. We conducted 299 bison surveys while traveling by foot, snowmobile, or pickup truck. When bison were encountered, we recorded herd size and composition, reaction of bison to our presence, and our distance from the herd. Following the detection of human presence, bison reacted by either approaching the observer (3% of 384 observations), looking in our direction while remaining in place (460%), or fleeing the area (51%). Bison were more likely to flee from a truck than a hiker and as likely to flee from a person traveling by snowmobile as from one on foot. The probability of flight by herds that included young bison (<1 year old) increased as the snowmobile got closer, reaching 50% at 257 m. The average daily radius (i.e., straight-line displacement over 24 hours) of female bison equipped with GPS collars increased 27-30% when they responded to human presence by fleeing compared to when there was no disturbance. There was no evidence, however, that the frequency of disturbance imposed on this population had an important impact on resource use. Variation in bison density among meadows was not related to the number of human disturbances. Instead, bison density was related to environmental factors such as snow depth in winter and water availability during the snow-free season. Additionally, human disturbance was not more frequent in the meadows where bison were observed relatively less than expected based on the abundance of their preferred plant species. Our observations indicated that humans can minimize their impact on bison by remaining farther than 260 m from herds and by being discreet when near large herds containing young bison.",WILDLIFE SOC,FAL,2003,nodoi1236388134,"Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.","Fortin, D (reprint author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P6, Canada.",NA

We tracked 24 individuals at three sites over two years. Movement patterns of Coachwhips changed in habitat fragments. As area available to the snakes was reduced, individuals faced increased crowding, had smaller home-range sizes, tolerated greater home-range overlap, and showed more concentrated movement activity and convoluted movement pathways. The behavioral response shown by Coachwhips suggests, on a regional level, area-effects alone cannot explain observed extinctions on habitat fragments but, instead, suggests changes in habitat configuration are more likely to explain the decline of this species. Ultimately, if ""edge-exposure"" is a common cause of decline, then isolated fragments, appropriately buffered to reduce emigration and edge effects, may support viable populations of fragmentation-sensitive species.",SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES,DEC,2009,101670081471,"[Mitrovich, Milan J.; Diffendorfer, Jay E.] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA./[Diffendorfer, Jay E.] US Geol Survey, Rocky Mt Geog Sci Ctr, Denver, CO 80225 USA./[Fisher, Robert N.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, San Diego Field Stn, San Diego, CA 92101 USA.","Mitrovich, MJ (reprint author), Green Shield Ecol Inc, 15360 Barranca Pkwy, Irvine, CA 92618 USA.",NA

Termites habituated to vibrational stimulation when in social groups, but failed to do so individually, indicating that habituation is a collective action. In assays on termite groups, both species demonstrated a similar pattern of behavioral responses to vibrational stimuli: evanescent cessation of activity and movement, followed by withdrawal from the vibration source. Groups of both species then gradually moved back toward the vibration source as a consequence of continuous exposure. However, it took a significantly shorter period for C. formosanus to return (57 s) to the test arena and to resume ( 80 s) normal foraging activities in the test arena compared with R. flavipes, which took 97 and 227 s, respectively, when exposed to the vibration frequency of 120 bmpm. High vibration frequency (240 bmpm) increased the time required to return (C. formosanus, 80 s; R. flavipes, 153 s) and to resume regular locomotion (C. formosanus, 186 s; R. flavipes, 263 s). Our experiments demonstrate that workers play a crucial part in adjusting groups of termites to distressful vibrations.

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) increase vigilance in response to coyote (Canis latrans) presence, but vigilance responses to spatiotemporal variation in coyote abundance are unknown. Therefore, we examined the relationship between deer foraging behavior and coyote abundance on two 2000-ha study areas in Georgia, USA, during 2010-2013. We used baited camera traps during fall and winter to quantify deer behavior (i.e., feeding or vigilant) and estimated coyote abundance using fecal genotyping to noninvasively mark and recapture individuals. During 2011 and 2012, coyote removals were implemented on each study area. Coyote abundance (i.e., predation risk) varied spatiotemporally and was a predictor of foraging behavior during at least one season for all sex-age classes of deer except juveniles. Adult males were more sensitive to predation risk in winter, after the breeding season, whereas adult females were sensitive to predation risk during both seasons, but more so during fall when offspring are at greater risk. Yearling males were more sensitive to predation risk than adult males, and juveniles were least sensitive to predation risk, likely because of inexperience and high energetic demands. Reproductive chronology explained sex-specific and seasonal antipredator responses to predation risk, but there was a non-linear relationship between indirect predator effects and direct predation risk for some sex-age classes. Our results suggest deer detect and respond behaviorally to variation in coyote abundance. Due to the widespread distribution of deer and their interactions at multiple trophic levels, the ecological implications of this finding may be wide-reaching.",WILEY,MAR,2018,101002ecs22141,"[Gulsby, William D.] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA./[Cherry, Michael J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA./[Johnson, James T.; Miller, Karl V.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA./[Conner, L.

Additionally, prey have imperfect information on the whereabouts of their predator, which the predator should incorporate in its patch use strategy. I used a one-predator-one-prey system, puma (Puma concolor)-mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to test the following predictions regarding predator-prey distribution and patch use by the predator. (1) Pumas will spend more time in high prey risk/low prey use habitat types, while deer will spend their time in low-risk habitats. Pumas should (2) select large forage patches more often, (3) remain in large patches longer, and (4) revisit individual large patches more often than individual smaller ones. I tested these predictions with an extensive telemetry data set collected over 16 years in a study area of patchy forested habitat. When active, pumas spent significantly less time in open areas of low intrinsic predation risk than did deer. Pumas used large patches more than expected, revisited individual large patches significantly more often than smaller ones, and stayed significantly longer in larger patches than in smaller ones. The results supported the prediction of a negative relationship in the spatial distribution of a predator and its prey and indicated that the predator is incorporating the prey's imperfect information about its presence.

Nevertheless, recent evidence indicates that in certain situations ungulate species may actually utilize areas associated with higher levels of human presence as a potential refuge from disturbance-sensitive predators. We now use four-years of behavioral activity budget data collected from pronghorn 9Antilocapra americana) and elk (Cervus elephus) in Grand Teton National Park, USA to test whether predictable patterns of human presence can provide a shelter from predatory risk. Daily behavioral scans were conducted along two parallel sections of road that differed in traffic volume - with the main Teton Park Road experiencing vehicle use that was approximately thirty-fold greater than the River Road. At the busier Teton Park Road, both species of ungulate engaged in higher levels of feeding 927% increase in the proportion of pronghorn feeding and 21% increase for elk), lower levels of alert behavior 918% decrease for pronghorn and 9% decrease for elk) and formed smaller groups. These responses are commonly associated with reduced predatory threat. Pronghorn also exhibited a 30% increase in the proportion of individuals moving at the River Road as would be expected under greater exposure to predation risk. Our findings concur with the 'predator shelter hypothesis', suggesting that ungulates in GTNP use human presence as a potential refuge from predation risk, adjusting their behavior accordingly.

From 2012-2014, we monitored quail populations via radio telemetry at Beaver River Wildlife Management Area, Beaver County, Oklahoma. We used cumulative distribution functions and resource utilization functions (RUFs) to determine behavioral responses of quail to water sources. We also used Program MARK to determine if water sources had any effect on quail vital rates. Our results indicated that both northern bobwhite and scaled quail exhibited behavioral responses to the presence of surface-water sources. Northern bobwhite selected for areas <700 m and <650 m from water sources during the breeding and nonbreeding season, respectively. However, the nonbreeding season response was weak ((beta) over bar = -0.06, SE = <0.01), and the breeding season (<(beta)over bar> = 0.01, SE = 0.02) response was nonsignificant on the basis of RUFs. Scaled quail selected for areas <650 m and b 250 m from water sources during the breeding and nonbreeding season, respectively. The breeding season RUF (<(beta)over bar> = -0.31, SE = 0.07) indicated a stronger response for scaled quail than bobwhite. Conversely, there was no direct effect of surface water on quail vital rates or nest success during the course of our study. Although water may affect behavioral patterns of quail, we found no evidence that it affects quail survival or nest success for these two species. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

We used acoustic biotelemetry tracking data to examine movement behaviors and migration success of a magneto-sensitive fish, late-fall run Chinook (LFC) salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), in relation to the energization of a magnetic field-producing subsea power cable, as well as other potentially influential environmental parameters. We analyzed detection records of tagged LFC salmon smolts during their out-migration through the San Francisco Bay before and after the installation of an 85-km high-voltage direct-current transmission cable. Cable energization did not significantly impact the proportion of fish that successfully migrated through the bay or the probability of successful migration. However, after cable energization, higher proportions of fish crossed the cable location and fish were more likely to be detected south of their normal migration route. Transit times through some regions were reduced during cable activity, but other environmental factors were more influential. Resource selection models indicated that proximity to the active cable varied by location: migration paths moved closer to the cable at some locations, but further away at others. Overall, cable activity appeared to have mixed, but limited effects on movements and migration success of smolts. Additional studies are recommended to further investigate impacts of subsea cables on fish migrations, including potential long-term consequences.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,AUG,2018,101007s0022701833850,"[Wyman, Megan T.; Klimley, A.

Environmental estrogen","Laboratory studies of adult male fathead minnows have shown that when they are exposed to estrogens, they lose their ability to compete for access to females and sire young, suggesting that estrogenic effluents may reduce the genetic fitness of populations of wild fishes. However, it is unknown whether wild fish which are exposed to effluent actually compete with unexposed fishes, how long effects of estrogen exposure last, and whether females are affected by estrogens. This study addressed these issues using the fathead minnow (FHM) and effluent from the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWTP) a well-studied source of environmental estrogens (EEs) in the Mississippi River. Maze tests found that adult FHMs are neither attracted nor repelled by MWTP effluent while previous studies have shown that minnows are attracted to the warmer waters which characterize effluents; it is realistic that previously unexposed fish enter MWTP effluent in the spring and then compete with exposed individuals. Competitive spawning experiments showed that male FHMs exposed to 44 ng E2/l (a high but realistic level) for three weeks failed to compete with unexposed males while males exposed to 4 ng E2/l outcompeted and sired more young than unexposed males (p < 0.05). The effects of estrogen exposure disappeared within a week of moving fish into uncontaminated water. Female FHM reproductive output and behavior were unaffected by exposure to estrogen. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the behavior of wild fishes likely determines their exposure to EEs and that while the effects of this exposure are likely significant to populations of wild fish, they will be location specific because of factors which determine the duration and intensity of male exposure. We conclude that the role of fish behavior in endocrine disruption strongly warrants additional consideration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon capture and storage","Sub-sea geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a viable option for the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) approach for reducing atmospheric emissions of this greenhouse gas. Although generally considered to offer a low risk of major leakage, it remains relevant to establish the possible consequences for marine organisms that live in or on sediments overlying these storage areas if such an event may occur. The present study has used a series of laboratory exposures and behavioral bioassays to establish the sensitivity of Arctica islandica to simulated leakages of CO2. This long-lived bivalve mollusc is widely distributed throughout the North Sea, an area where geological storage is currently taking place and where there are plans to expand this operation significantly. A recently published model has predicted a maximum drop of 1.9 pH units in seawater at the point source of a substantial escape of CO2 from sub-sea geological storage in this region. Valve movements of A. islandica exposed to reduced pH seawater were recorded continuously using Hall effect proximity sensors. Valve movement regulation is important for optimising the flow of water over the gills, which supplies food and facilitates respiration. A stepwise reduction in seawater pH showed an initial increase in both the rate and extent of valve movements in the majority of individuals tested when pH fell to 6.2 units. Exposing A. islandica to pH 6.2 seawater continuously for seven days resulted in a clear increase in valve movements during the first 40 h of exposure, followed by a gradual reduction in activity intensity over the subsequent five days, suggesting acclimation. The ability of both exposed and control bivalves to burrow successfully into sediment on completion of this exposure was very similar. A final exposure trial, testing whether increased valve movements initiated by reduced pH were related to foot extension during attempted burrowing, found no such association. In summary, significant changes in valve behavior did not occur until seawater pH fell to 6.2 units. The response took the form of an increase in valve activity rather than closure. The absence of foot extension coincident with increased valve movements indicates A. islandica were not attempting to burrow, leaving the possibility that valve movements are supporting a respiratory response to hypercapnia. In conclusion, A. islandica appears to be tolerant of reductions in seawater pH equivalent to those predicted for substantial losses of CO2 through leakage from sub-sea geological storage.

Most ectotherms are expected to adjust their behavior to avoid extreme temperatures and minimize acute changes in body temperature. However, measuring such behavioral plasticity in the wild is challenging. Combining 4years of telemetry-derived behavioral data on juvenile and adult (30-80cm) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and in situ ocean temperature measurements, we found a significant effect of sea temperature on cod depth use and activity level in coastal Skagerrak. During summer, cod were found in deeper waters when sea surface temperature increased. Further, this effect of temperature was stronger on larger cod. Diel vertical migration, which consists in a nighttime rise to shallow feeding habitats, was stronger among smaller cod. As surface temperature increased beyond similar to 15 degrees C, their vertical migration was limited to deeper waters. In addition to larger diel vertical migrations, smaller cod were more active and travelled larger distances compared to larger specimens. Cold temperatures during winter tended, however, to reduce the magnitude of diel vertical migrations, as well as the activity level and distance moved by those smaller individuals. Our findings suggest that future and ongoing rises in sea surface temperature may increasingly deprive cod in this region from shallow feeding areas during summer, which may be detrimental for local populations of the species.",WILEY,MAY,2015,101002ece31496,"[Freitas, Carla; Olsen, Esben Moland; Moland, Even; Knutsen, Halvor] Univ Agder, Dept Nat Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway./[Freitas, Carla; Olsen, Esben Moland; Moland, Even; Knutsen, Halvor] Inst Marine Res, N-4817 Flodevigen, His, Norway./[Freitas, Carla] Univ Porto, Ctr Marine & Environm Res CIIMAR CIMAR, P-4050123 Oporto, Portugal./[Olsen, Esben Moland; Knutsen, Halvor] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Syntheses CEES, Dept Biosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway./[Ciannelli, Lorenzo] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.","Freitas, C (reprint author), Univ Agder, Dept Nat Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, Post Box 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",4449760

Almost one million visitors entered Yellowstone National Park by motorized means on snowmobiles (87%) or snow coaches (13%) during 1992-2003. Most vehicles toured the central portion of the park where bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus) concentrate in geothermal areas. We sampled > 6500 interactions between groups of these species and groups of snowmobiles and snow coaches (collectively, OSV, over-snow vehicles) during five winters (1999-2000, 2002-2004). Multinomial logits models were used to identify conditions leading to behavioral responses. Elk responded three times as often (52%) as bison (19%). during interactions with groups of snowmobiles and snow coaches due to increased vigilance responses (elk, 44%; bison, 10%). However, the frequency of higher-intensity movement responses by bison and elk were similar (6-7% travel, 1-2% flight, < 1% defense) and relatively low compared to other studies of ungulates and snowmobile disturbance. The likelihood of active responses by bison and elk,increased significantly if animals were on or near roads, groups were smaller, or humans approached. The likelihood of an active response by bison decreased within winters having the largest visitation, suggesting some habituation to snowmobiles and snow coaches. There was no evidence that snowmobile use during the past 35 years affected the population dynamics or demography of bison or elk. Thus, we suggest that regulations restricting levels and travel routes of over-snow vehicles (OSVs) were effective at reducing disturbances to bison and elk below a level that would cause measurable fitness effects. We recommend park managers consider maintaining OSV traffic levels at or below those observed during our study. Regardless, differing interpretations of the behavioral and physiological response data will continue to exist because of the diverse values and beliefs of the many constituencies of Yellowstone.",WILEY,OCT,2006,1018901051076120060161911BROBAE20CO2,"Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA./Natl Pk Serv, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA./Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.","Borkowski, JJ (reprint author), Montana State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",NA

Factors eliciting displacement and the nutritional consequences of behavioral changes were measured. GPS collars were deployed to track temporal and spatial resource use and scan and focal observations were used to quantify foraging efficiency, Vigilance behavior, and bear use of various food resources. Total food intake was quantified by combining data on food resource use based on GPS locations and foraging efficiency was measured using spotting scopes from long distances. Seasonal food availability and quality were monitored and utilized as co-variates in comparisons between pre-treatment and treatment years. Though the bear population exhibited significant behavioral differences between the presence and absence of humans, changes in behavior generally mediated effects on total food intake. Adult males at a salt marsh viewing area were the only sex/age class exhibiting reduced food intake resulting from a 15% decline in foraging time when viewers were present. Salmon intake did not differ between pre-treatment and treatment years despite a 10% decline in time spent fishing when viewers were present. The tightly controlled experimental bear-viewing introduced in this study allowed bears to evaluate predation risk associated with human activity and optimally respond to minimize costs due to changes in foraging activities.

These hypoxic events may cause direct and indirect mortality of crabs as well as alter their distribution and abundance patterns. We used biotelemetry techniques with concurrent hydrographic measurements to monitor movement responses of free-ranging crabs to the spatiotemporal dynamics of hypoxic upwelling events. Shallow areas (<1.7 m depth) were rarely hypoxic (<1 % of the time) and should offer refuge for mobile organisms that avoid low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations during hypoxic upwelling events within the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA. Free-ranging blue crabs generally attempted to avoid hypoxic water (<4 mg l(-1)) by moving inshore towards higher DO concentrations; however, crabs were unsuccessful at moving to normoxic water (>4 mg l(-1)) after exposure to hypoxia during upwelling events. Furthermore, telemetered crabs sometimes remained within severely hypoxic water (<2 mg l(-1)) for several hours. We discuss potential behavioral mechanisms that may explain these surprising results and compare the movement response of our individuals to the population-level movement responses inferred from trawling studies. To better understand the impacts of episodic hypoxic upwelling events on local blue crab populations, future studies need to identify the mechanisms blue crabs use to detect hypoxia and to orient towards more suitable (i.e. normoxic) habitats. Our results suggest that the movement responses of individuals to disturbance events can be used to predict changes in the distribution and abundance patterns of local populations.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2003,103354meps259215,"N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","Bell, GW (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Box 8208, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",10_3354_meps259215

During hypoxic upwelling events mobile predators may reduce their feeding activity as they migrate to relatively shallower, oxygenated water, and may reinvade deep-water habitats during relaxation of hypoxia to exploit vulnerable infaunal prey (e.g. clams and polychaete worms) that have reduced their burial depth in response to hypoxia. We used biotelemetry techniques with concurrent measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) to monitor the feeding and movement responses of free-ranging blue crabs Callinectes sapidus to episodic hypoxic upwelling and subsequent relaxation events within the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA. Although telemetered crabs fed in hypoxic water with DO concentrations as low as 1.01 mg l(-1), percent feeding occurrence declined slightly when crabs were exposed to mild (DO = 2 - 4 mg l(-1)) and severe hypoxia (DO <2 mg l(-1)), relative to normoxic concentrations (DO > 4 mg l(-1)). Crabs reduced the proportion of time spent feeding during hypoxic upwelling conditions except for the most severe events when DO dropped rapidly from normoxia to severe hypoxia. The proportion of time crabs spent feeding did not increase and crabs did not reinvade deeper water habitats during relaxation events, as was hypothesized. These results are somewhat inconsistent with previous studies and we suggest that crabs may have fed on prey other than benthic infauna, or that upwelling events may not have lasted long enough to cause infauna to migrate close enough to the sediment surface to be vulnerable to predation by blue crabs. Our study highlights the importance of examining the complex interaction between the hydrodynamics of episodic events and various behaviors (e.g. feeding and movement) when trying to understand the impact of these events on estuarine trophic dynamics.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2003,103354meps259227,"N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","Bell, GW (reprint author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Box 8208, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",10_3354_meps259227

We experimentally evaluated the effects of 3 dewatering rates on behavior of 6 freshwater mussel species in the context of water-removal rates observed in 21 Atlantic Coast rivers. Horizontal movement differed significantly among species and dewatering rates, but a significant species x dewatering interaction suggested that these factors influence movement in complex ways. Species differences in movement were evident only in controls and under slow dewatering rates, but these differences disappeared at moderate and fast dewatering rates. Burrowing behavior did not differ with respect to species identity or dewatering rate. The proportion of individuals that became stranded did not differ among species, but most individuals became stranded under low and moderate dewatering, and all individuals became stranded under fast dewatering. Mortality after stranding differed strongly among species along a gradient from 25% in Pyganodon cataracta to 92% in Alasmidonta marginata. Together, these results suggest that species behavior may differ under gradual dewatering, but all species in our study are poorly adapted for rapid dewatering. Most of the 21 rivers we assessed experienced dewatering events comparable to our moderate rate, and several experienced events comparable to our fast rate. Dewatering events that exceed the movement or survival capability of most mussel species can be expected to result in assemblage-wide impacts.

The behavior of pods was recorded from commercial whale-watching vessels during tours and compared to pods observed in the absence of vessels from the shore in the same area. While some individuals showed obvious signs of horizontal avoidance, others approached vessels, initiating interactions. Calf pods were more sensitive to the presence of vessels than non-calf pods. Dive times and the overall percentage of time whales spent submerged were higher in the presence of vessels, but respiration intervals did not differ. Some surface behaviors occurred less often in the presence of vessels. Whales' responses differed according to whether vessels were operating in accordance with regulations or not. Whales were more likely to avoid a vessel moving within the permitted 100 m approach limit than vessels outside the limit. Whales showed some behavioral changes when vessels operated in accordance with whale-watching regulations, compared with whales in the absence of vessels. Pods that showed no obvious horizontal responses to vessels changed their diving and surface activity when compared with pods in the absence of vessels. Because the long-term impacts of effects of vessels are unknown, management of the humpback whale-watching industry should adopt a conservative approach. Improved knowledge of long-term impacts of multiple exposures to vessels is required to inform management of the effects of whale-watching.","WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",JAN,2010,101111j17487692200900320x,"[Stamation, Kasey A.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia./[Croft, David B.] Univ New S Wales, Arid Zone Field Stn, Sydney, NSW 2880, Australia./[Shaughnessy, Peter D.] S Australian Museum, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia./[Waples, Kelly A.] Dept Environm & Conservat, Perth, WA 6983, Australia./[Briggs, Sue V.] CSIRO, NSW Dept Environm & Climate Change, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.","Stamation, KA (reprint author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",NA

The speed achieved by each whale during pursuit was registered by GPS receivers onboard two inflatable zodiac boats. Respiratory frequencies were significantly lower (n = 15, p <0.05) before (mean = 0.89 +/- 0.06 blows/min) compared with after (1.39 +/- 0.15) tagging. The same effect was observed for the speed of each animal (mean = 10.96 +/- 0.44 km/h and 12.54 +/- 0.57 km/h; n = 13, p < 0.05). Both variables were positively correlated with the duration of the pursuit (n = 21, r = 0.88, p < 0.05; n = 13, r = 0.94, p < 0.01) and with each other (n = 26, r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Acute responses were observed in 50% of the 28 tag deployments. Pursuits were shown to generate a longer effect than tagging. We suggest that the behavioral changes presented here are short-term disturbances because the tagging operation ends quickly and is not a repeated procedure. However, protocols must be developed to guarantee the maintenance of the animals' welfare during operations.","SOC BRASILEIRA ZOOLOGIA, UNIV FEDERAL PARANA",FEB,2010,nodoi2389584192,"[Alves, Luiz Claudio P. de S.; Moreira, Sergio; Simoes-Lopes, Paulo C.; Andriolo, Artur] Inst Aqualie, Projeto Monitoramento Baleias Satelite, BR-22763010 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil./[Alves, Luiz Claudio P. de S.] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Meio Ambiente, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil./[Simoes-Lopes, Paulo C.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Ctr Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol & Zool, Lab Mamiferos Aquat, BR-88040970 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil./[Andriolo, Artur] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, BR-36036900 Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil.","Alves, LCPD (reprint author), Inst Aqualie, Projeto Monitoramento Baleias Satelite, Rua Edgard Werneck 428-32, BR-22763010 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",NA

We examined the behavioral responses of nesting female Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) to human disturbance using both experimental and observational approaches. From April to August 2006 and 2007, we monitored Northern Cardinal nests in 18 riparian forests in Ohio, USA. Two experimental trials were conducted at each nest (N = 63), with Flight Initiation Distance (FID, the distance at which a bird flushed from the nest) recorded as we approached nests by walking directly toward them and by walking along trails located variable distances from nests. We also measured flight initiation distance (FID) when nests were approached during routine nest checks (N = 160). Cardinals were six times more likely to flush when nests were approached directly, and females on higher nests were less likely to flush regardless of distance to trail. FID was not significantly influenced by the distance of nests from trails. We found no association between nest survival and the tendency of birds to flush. Rather, nest survival was best explained by nest height. Thus, our findings suggest that the responses of birds to human use of recreational trails have only short-term effects, with no apparent effects of on nest survival. Because the reaction of birds to humans in our study depended on how nests were approached, studies where FID is used as an indicator of sensitivity to human disturbance and is determined by direct approaches may overestimate the potential impact of trails on nesting birds.",WILEY,JUN,2010,101111j15579263201000270x,"[Smith-Castro, Jennifer R.; Rodewald, Amanda D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","Smith-Castro, JR (reprint author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, 4625 Morse Rd,Suite 104, Columbus, OH 43230 USA.",NA

Factors such as chemical contaminants may affect habitat selection and movement of amphibians in human-altered habitats and contribute to landscape-level patterns of distribution and abundance. The objective of this study was to determine if the Strawberry Poison Frog (Oophaga pumilio (Schmidt, 1857)) can use olfactory cues to detect and avoid the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup T. Fifty frogs were captured in the field in Costa Rica and tested in experimental arenas where they were given a choice between a control and an herbicide treatment. Analysis of time spent in treatment areas revealed a significant interaction between sex and treatment. Analyses of choice at the start and end of the trials indicated that sex and cardinal direction were important factors influencing orientation behavior. These results suggest that males and females differed in their behavioral responses, and that male O. pumilio may use olfactory cues to detect and avoid areas treated with glyphosate-based herbicide. However, the sampled population was male-biased, which resulted in a lower sample size and lower power to detect an effect for females. Further work is needed to better understand amphibian behavioral responses to herbicides, as well as the role of sex and individual variation in modifying these responses.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",NOV,2014,101139cjz20140111,"[Farabaugh, N.

Population growth depends on the ability of individuals to adapt to these changes by making use of new habitat features and at the same time to avoid increased risks of mortality associated with human infrastructure. We analyzed the summer movements of 19 GPS-collared resident wolves (Canis lupus L.) from 14 territories in Scandinavia in relation to roads. We used resource and step selection functions, including > 12000 field-checked GPS-positions and 315 kill sites. Wolves displayed ambivalent responses to roads depending on the spatial scale, road type, time of day, behavioral state, and reproductive status. At the site scale (approximately 0.1 km(2)), they selected for roads when traveling, nearly doubling their travel speed. Breeding wolves moved the fastest. At the patch scale (10 km(2)), house density rather than road density was a significant negative predictor of wolf patch selection. At the home range scale (approximately 1000 km(2)), breeding wolves increased gravel road use with increasing road availability, although at a lower rate than expected. Wolves have adapted to use roads for ease of travel, but at the same time developed a cryptic behavior to avoid human encounters. This behavioral plasticity may have been important in allowing the successful recovery of wolf populations in industrialized countries. However, we emphasize the role of roads as a potential cause of increased human-caused mortality.We studied how wolves in Scandinavia respond to roads built to ease human travel but degrading habitat quality for many wildlife species. Wolves responded with ambivalence: They both selected and avoided roads, all depending on the spatial and temporal scale and their behavioral status.

All the test individuals were collected from aquaculture research ponds, in which they had had no prior contact with the other species and predation risks, excluding cannibalism, were reduced. The experimental design consisted in subjecting 20 crayfish per species to (1) a 3-min control phase after the injection of 20 ml of water and (2) a 3-min test phase after the injection of 20 ml of one of three test solutions (food odor, conspecific odor plus food odor, heterospecific odor plus food odor). We found that the two species differ on one hand for their background behavior and on the other for the intensity and quality of their responses to the three types of cues. Firstly, P. clarkii appeared more active than P acutus acutus during the control phase and responded in a stronger fashion to the injection of the solutions. Secondly, we recorded an increased locomotion in P. acutus acutus with food and heterospecific cues (by moving crayfish maximize the chance of finding food), but not with conspecific odors (by not moving, crayfish reduce their exposure to visual predators). To the contrary, at the injection of the three test solutions P. clarkii displayed clear feeding-related activities (although less intense with conspecific odors) as opposed to the danger reactions shown in a previous study on individuals from a naturalized population of the same species.

Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer.

Weimerskirch, Henri",NA,NA,NA,"Animals are attracted to human food subsidies worldwide. The behavioral response of individuals to these resources is rarely described in detail, beyond chances of encounters. Seabirds for instance scavenge in large numbers at fishing boats, triggering crucial conservation issues, but how the response to boats varies across encounters is poorly known. Here we examine the behavioral response of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans), equipped with GPS tags, to longline fishing boats operating near their colony for which we had access to vessel monitoring system data. We distinguish between encounters (flying within 30 km of a boat) and attendance behavior (sitting on the sea within 3 km of a boat), and examine factors affecting each. In particular, we test hypotheses that the response to encountered boats should vary with sex and age in this long-lived dimorphic species. Among the 60% trips that encountered boats at least once, 80% of them contained attendance (but attendance followed only 60% of each single encounter). Birds were more attracted and remained attending longer when boats were hauling lines, despite the measures enforced by this fleet to limit food availability during operations. Sex and age of birds had low influence on the response to boats, except the year when fewer boats came fishing in the area, and younger birds were attending further from boats compared to older birds. Net mass gain of birds was similar across sex and not affected by time spent attending boats. Our results indicate albatrosses extensively attend this fishery, with no clear advantages, questioning impacts on foraging time budgets. Factors responsible for sex foraging segregation at larger scale seem not to operate at this fleet near the colony and are not consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory on potential individual dominance asymmetries. This approach complements studies of large-scale overlap of animals with human subsidies.",NA,MAY,2017,101002ece32677,NA,NA,10_1002_ece3_2677

Whether and how landscape manipulations can be used to slow invasive species is of great interest, in particular in forest ecosystems, where tree removal, thinning, and increasing tree diversity are discussed as management options. Classically, the focus is on availability and accessibility of resources; more recent considerations include individual-level behavioral movement responses to a spatially heterogeneous resource distribution. We derive a novel model for insect-host dynamics that includes three common behavioral aspects of foraging: higher movement rate in resource-poor areas, lower ovipositioning rate in resource-poor areas, and movement preference for resource-rich areas. We show that each of these basic mechanisms can increase the speed of invasion in a source-sink landscape above that in a homogeneous landscape with larger overall resource availability. We parameterize our model and illustrate our results with data for emerald ash borer, a recent highly destructive forest pest in North America. Our results highlight the importance of empirical work on movement behavior in different landscape types and near the interface between types.",NA,MAY,2017,101002ecy1773suppinfo,NA,NA,NA

Dispersal is a nonlinear process through which different behavioral mechanisms could affect movement patterns. One of the most common approaches to analyzing the trajectories of organisms within patches is to use random-walk models to describe movement features. These models express individual movements within a specific area in terms of random-walk parameters in an effort to relate movement patterns to the distributions of organisms in space. However, only using the movement trajectories of individuals to predict the spatial spread of animal populations may not fit the complex distribution of individuals across heterogeneous environments. When we empirically tested the results from a random-walk model (a residence index) used to predict the spatial equilibrium distribution of individuals, we found that the index severely underestimated the spatial spread of dispersing individuals. We believe this is because random-walk models only account for the effects of environmental conditions on individual movements, completely overlooking the crucial influence of behavior changes over time. In the future, both aspects should be accounted for when predicting general rules of (meta) population abundance, distribution, and dynamics from patterns of animal movements.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,OCT,2008,101086590964,"[del Mar Delgado, Maria; Penteriani, Vincenzo] CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41013, Spain.","Delgado, MD (reprint author), CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Ave Maria Luisa S-N,Pabellon Peru,Apartado 1056, Seville 41013, Spain.",10_1086_590964

We examined interspecific aggressive interactions in the 2 gray tree frog species, Hyla chrysoscelis and Hyla versicolor. These species call side by side in the same ponds, and acoustic interference occurs because of the similar spectral characteristics of their vocalizations. The aggressive calls of these 2 species, although very similar, were statistically distinguishable: calls of H. chrysoscelis were more strongly amplitude modulated than those of H. versicolor. We used playbacks and staged interactions to characterize the behaviors of males exposed to heterospecific competitors or their signals. Males readily responded with aggression to heterospecific individuals and playbacks of their calls. These behaviors were qualitatively similar in both intraspecific and interspecific interactions, but there were some significant differences. First, males of H. chrysoscelis were more aggressive toward playbacks of conspecific advertisement calls than toward those of H. versicolor. There were no significant differences in this respect in H. versicolor. Second, interspecific interactions were usually more escalated than intraspecific interactions and more likely to end with the loser moving away from its opponent. Although neither species had an advantage in staged interactions, behavioral responses were asymmetrical because H. versicolor was more likely than H. chrysoscelis to initiate physical contact. Previous studies showed that H. versicolor suffers from a greater reduction in attractiveness than H. chrysoscelis in the presence of heterospecific call overlap. Thus, the asymmetries in aggressive behavior between the 2 species may be related to differential costs of heterospecific competition.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,MAY-JUN,2014,101093behecoaru016,"[Reichert, Michael S.; Gerhardt, H.

To that end, we used a simulation model to investigate three questions about behavioral tradeoffs that dispersing animals might face: (i) speed of movement against risk of predation, (ii) speed of movement against foraging, and (iii) perceptual range against risk of predation. The first investigation demonstrated that dispersing animals can generally benefit by slowing from maximal speed to perform anti-predatory behavior. The optimal speed was most strongly influenced by the disperser's energetic reserves, the risk of predation it faced, the interaction between these two parameters, and the effectiveness of its anti-predatory behavior. Patch arrangement and the search strategy employed by the dispersers had marginal effects on this tradeoff relative to the above parameters. The second investigation demonstrated that slowing movement to forage during dispersal may increase success and that optimum speed of dispersal was primarily a function of the dispersing animal's energetic reserves, predation risk, and their interaction. The richness (density of food resources) of the interpatch matrix and the patch arrangement had relatively minor impacts on how much time a dispersing animal should spend foraging. The final investigation demonstrated animals may face tradeoffs between dispersing under conditions that involve a low risk of predation but limit their ability to perceive distant habitat (necessitating more time spent searching for habitat) and conditions that are inherently more risky but allow animals to perceive distant habitat more readily. The precise nature of this tradeoff was sensitive to the form of the relationship between predation risk and perceptual range. Our overall results suggest that simple depictions of these behavioral tradeoffs might suffice in spatially explicit population models.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,FEB,2005,101111j00301299200513711x,"US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA./Indiana State Univ, Dept Life Sci, Terre Haute, IN 47809 USA.","Zollner, PA (reprint author), US Forest Serv, USDA, N Cent Res Stn, 5985 Highway K, Rhinelander, WI 54501 USA.",NA

This is particularly true for small and nocturnal animals that inhabit structurally complex environments, such as Dromiciops gliroides. We studied different behavioral traits of this species in its natural environment during the fruiting season of the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Using videos recorded by camera traps, we obtained data regarding activity levels, time allocation, feeding patterns, and movement velocities of this frugivore. Our results showed that this small marsupial seemed to avoid moonlight, and to balance the costs generated by feeding during brightest nights (i.e., when more conspicuous to predators) feeds at higher rates than during less-illuminated nights. Feeding pattern analyses showed that D. gliroides can consume between 1 and 10 fruits per plant, but generally consumes 3 fruits. We also observed that the mean time needed for D. gliroides to extract and manipulate a fruit was 6 s. Time allocation analyses showed that, on average, individuals stayed on T. corymbosus and its hosts for 55 s, and allocate most of that time on feeding and moving within the mistletoe. Video analyses were demonstrated to be a useful sampling technique, which, in addition to allowing us to obtain information about activity patterns, also permitted us to assess fruit consumption patterns, visit lengths, and time allocation when visiting mistletoe. Moreover, video allowed us to understand the variability of movement velocities under different behavioral states. The information we provide here could be included into models to simulate seed dispersal in a more realistic and accurate way that incorporates not only spatial distribution of resources, but also detailed behavioral information of frugivores.",ALLIANCE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP DIVISION ALLEN PRESS,DEC,2014,10164413MAMMA281,"[Di Virgilio, Agustina; Amico, Guillermo C.; Morales, Juan Manuel] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","Di Virgilio, A (reprint author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Lab Ecotono, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",NA

As it is becoming apparent that activity plays an integral role in a number of physiological processes including arousal, attention, cardiovascular health and body weight regulation, there is an increased interest in quantifying activity. Nonhuman primates are particularly useful experimental models; for such studies in that they exhibit a repertoire of activity more similar to humans than the activity of animals such as rodents and domestic animals. Recent studies measuring activity in nonhuman primates have used omnidirectional accelerometers, often worn on collars; however, the exact behaviors and movements detected by monkeys wearing these devices have not yet been characterized. To test the hypothesis that collar-worn accelerometers primarily detect movements that involve movement of the whole body, 16 adult female rhesus monkeys, housed individually in stainless steel cages, wore loose-fitting collars with an attached small metal box housing an activity monitor (Actical omnidirectional accelerometer; MiniMitter Inc., Bend, OR) and behavior was videotaped. Videotaped behaviors were analyzed by frame-by-frame analysis. There was a significant correlation between total (all) movement revealed by videotape analysis and activity counts detected by the accelerometers (r(s) = 0.612, P = 0.012), primarily reflecting a strong correlation between whole body movement and activity counts (r(s) = 0.647, P = 0.007). In contrast, arm movement (r(s) = -0.221, P = 0.412) and head/neck movement (r(s) = 0.193, P = 0.474) were not correlated with activity counts. These findings support the hypothesis that activity monitor placement on a collar allows for effective quantification of whole body movement in monkeys, and indicate that behaviors such as chewing and arm movement do not significantly influence activity recorded by collar-mounted accelerometers.",WILEY-LISS,FEB,2008,101002ajp20476,"[Papailiou, Athan; Sullivan, Elinor; Cameron, Judy L.] OHSU, ONPRC, Div Reprod Sci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA./[Papailiou, Athan; Sullivan, Elinor; Cameron, Judy L.] OHSU, ONPRC, Div Neurosci, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA./[Sullivan, Elinor; Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Portland, OR USA./[Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Behav Neurosci, Portland, OR USA./[Cameron, Judy L.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Portland, OR USA./[Cameron, Judy L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychiat, Pittsburgh, PA USA.","Cameron, JL (reprint author), OHSU, ONPRC, Div Reprod Sci, 505 NW 185th Ave, Beaverton, OR 97006 USA.",NA

Although behavioural strategies in marine mammals and seabirds have been investigated in detail, little is known about the deepest-diving reptile - the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Here, we deployed tri-axial accelerometers on female leatherbacks nesting on St Croix, US Virgin Islands, to explore their diving strategy. Our results show a consistent behavioural pattern within dives among individuals, with an initial period of active swimming at relatively steep descent angles (similar to-40 deg), with a stroke frequency of 0.32 Hz, followed by a gliding phase. The depth at which the gliding phase began increased with the maximum depth of the dives. In addition, descent body angles and vertical velocities were higher during deeper dives. Leatherbacks might thus regulate their inspired air-volume according to the intended dive depth, similar to hard-shelled turtles and penguins. During the ascent, turtles actively swam with a stroke frequency of 0.30. Hz but with a low vertical velocity (similar to 0.40 ms(-1)) and a low pitch angle (similar to+ 26 deg). Turtles might avoid succumbing to decompression sickness ('the bends') by ascending slowly to the surface. In addition, we suggest that the low body temperature of this marine ectotherm compared with that of endotherms might help reduce the risk of bubble formation by increasing the solubility of nitrogen in the blood. This physiological advantage, coupled with several behavioural and physical adaptations, might explain the particular ecological niche the leatherback turtle occupies among marine reptiles.",COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,DEC 1,2010,101242jeb048207,"[Fossette, Sabrina; Gleiss, Adrian C.; Liebsch, Nikolai; Hays, Graeme C.; Wilson, Rory P.] Swansea Univ, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Dept Pure & Appl Ecol, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales./[Myers, Andy E.; Lutcavage, Molly E.] Univ New Hampshire, Large Pelag Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03290 USA./[Garner, Steve] WIMARCS, St Croix, VI 00840 USA./[Whitney, Nicholas M.] Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.","Fossette, S (reprint author), Swansea Univ, Inst Environm Sustainabil, Dept Pure & Appl Ecol, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",NA

The study was carried out on an organic dairy farm with 52 tied cows. The cows were randomly assigned to one of four treatments, with 13 cows in each group, and matched according to lactation number, milk production and whether or not they were de-horned. The treatments were: exercise every day (E7), exercise two days per week (E2), exercise one day per week (E1) or no exercise (NoE). Exercised cows were brought to one of two outdoor paddocks for 1 h. Observations of behaviour were made using one-zero sampling during the 1 h exercise, twice per month and treatment, during the six months of winter housing (780 min per group in total). Treatment NoE was observed in their stalls during the same time as the other treatments were exercised. The duration of the two phases of the lying down movement was recorded four times per cow. Claw traits were recorded at trimming at the beginning and the end of the six month study period. The farm measured the individual milk yield one day per month.
There was an increase in the mean percentage of walking and trotting with decreasing access to exercise. Cows in the E1 and E2 treatment explored the environment more than cows in the E7 treatment. The wear of the claws during the winter was greater for the exercised cows compared to NoE and resulted in shorter claws at spring trimming. There was no difference in the duration of lying down movements for different treatments, nor a difference in milk production.
These results shows that adult dairy cows used the time to walk, trot and explore the environment when given access to an outdoor paddock, and that exercise had a positive effect on the claw conformation.

To maximize the volume of prey acquired in a dive with limited oxygen supplies, balaenids must either filter feed only occasionally when prey density is particularly high, or they must swim at slow speeds while filtering to reduce drag and oxygen consumption. Using digital tags with three-axis accelerometers, we studied bowhead whales feeding off West Greenland and present here, to our knowledge, the first detailed data on the kinematics and swimming behaviour of a balaenid whale filter feeding at depth. Bowhead whales employ a continuous fluking gait throughout the bottom phase of foraging dives, moving at very slow speeds (less than 1 m s(-1)), allowing them to filter feed continuously at depth. Despite the slow speeds, the large mouth aperture provides a water filtration rate of approximately 3 m(3) s(-1), amounting to some 2000 tonnes of water and prey filtered per dive. We conclude that a food niche of dense, slow-moving zooplankton prey has led balaenids to evolve locomotor and filtering systems adapted to work against a high drag at swimming speeds of less than 0.07 body length s(-1) using a continuous fluking gait very different from that of nekton-feeding, aquatic predators.",ROYAL SOC,NOV 7,2009,101098rspb20091135,"[Simon, Malene] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Dept Birds & Mammals, Nuuk 3900, Greenland./[Simon, Malene; Madsen, Peter T.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Biol Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark./[Johnson, Mark; Tyack, Peter; Madsen, Peter T.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.","Simon, M (reprint author), Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Dept Birds & Mammals, POB 570,Kivioq 2, Nuuk 3900, Greenland.",NA

Thirty-two multiparous Danish Holstein Frisian cows with an unassisted calving were studied from 96 h before until 96 h after calving while housed in individual calving pens. Data on behaviour were obtained via video recordings and accelerometers attached to the cows' legs. Cows spent less time lying, had more lying bouts and were more active the day before calving as compared to 2-4 days before calving. The number of lying bouts and the level of activity increased throughout the 6 h prior to calving. During the last 2 h prior to calving the duration of contractions and the number of times the cow turned her head towards the abdomen were increased, while the duration of feeding and drinking was decreased. Within minutes after calving cows stood up and licked their calves; second parity cows had a longer latency to stand than later parity cows. Sniffing and licking the calf peaked during the first hour after calving and decreased during the five successive hours, while calves' sniffing the cow peaked during the second hour after birth. The high level of cows' sniffing and licking their calves coincided with low levels of lying and feeding during the first hours after calving. Compared to the first 6-h period after calving, cows spent more time lying and feeding during the following two 6-h periods, while the duration of sniffing and licking calf and the number of lying bouts decreased throughout the 24 h after calving. Calves spent the most time sniffing the cow and suckling during the first 6-h period after birth, while the time spent lying increased and the number of lying bouts decreased throughout the 2411 following birth. Cows spent more time lying on the second day after calving than on the first clay after calving. The results show marked behavioural changes during the last 6h prior to calving and suggest that behavioural changes may be useful indicators of imminent calving. Furthermore, the results show that the first hours after calving contain most cow-calf interaction. These behaviours were at the expense of the cows' resting and feeding, which showed a rebound during the subsequent hours and the following day. This suggests that ample opportunity to rest and feed during the first days after calving may be beneficial for cow welfare. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Reintroduced populations are typically low in density in the initial years of establishment; hence, understanding natal dispersal patterns in this context is a critical component of reintroduction biology. Natal dispersal is a key behaviour that influences both the probability of recruitment, and simultaneously dictates the spatial configuration of the reintroduced population as it establishes. Here, we examine natal dispersal in a reintroduced population of an endangered New Zealand forest passerine, the hihi, Notiomystis cincta, in the first 3 years after reintroduction to a large, mature forest reserve. We examined (1) differences between the sexes, and (2) the relationship between temperament and natal dispersal distances (NDD) in locally bred hihi over this time period. We found NDD varied widely in both sexes, with mean NDD significantly higher in males than females. There was a sex-specific effect of temperament, with males that distress-called during handling dispersing further than those that did not. Our results show that while clusters of individuals have established across the reserve due to conspecific attraction, there is movement between these clusters, primarily a consequence of dispersal of males of a distinct temperament. Continuing to monitor natal dispersal patterns as populations establish will provide further insights into the role of dispersal in shaping establishment patterns in reintroduced populations.",NA,APR,2017,101111acv12296,NA,NA,NA

Cod tended to aggregate in the innermost part of the fjord, occupying distinct demersal home territories, showing horizontal movements consistent with foraging. Tidal influences were not observed; cod spent more time near the surface at night. Cod behaviour during peak post-smolt migration differed from that before and after migration. First, cod tended to have more-focused spatial distributions during peak post-smolt migration, consistent with them not having to forage so far when prey were available in abundance. Second, some half the cod were detected nocturnally (but rarely during daylight) near the river mouth during peak post-smolt migration, consistent with them feeding on nocturnally migrating post-smolts. Third, cod were more common near the surface, consistent with them feeding on post-smolts migrating through near-surface waters.

The current study followed 14 bulls during loading and holding in bucking chutes prior to release into an arena for performance at a large outdoor Canadian rodeo, typical to the North American region, to evaluate the welfare of bulls immediately prior to their performance in the rodeo. The study was conducted over a two year period. Bulls spent an average of 36.4 +/- 6.4 (mean +/- SD) min in the bucking chute (range 27-50 min). During loading into the bucking chutes, balking was most common in areas with changes in direction of movement or reductions in space (P=0.01). Humans were present in 64.7% of the balking events. There was a positive correlation between the agonistic bull and handler behaviours during loading (rho = 0.7, P=0.01). While being held in the bucking chutes prior to performance, 70% of the bulls showed no behaviours associated with aggression or escape, and when displayed, the majority of behaviours were displayed less than two to three times by individual bulls. Greater than half of the displays of escape or agonistic behaviours by bucking bulls occurred at the same time as human activities that were not inherent to the rodeo performance. Two bulls displayed bucking and/or rearing behaviour while being held in the bucking chutes and this behaviour was most common during the mounting phase where there are many cues that indicate the approaching performance. Chute behaviour scores were negatively correlated with number of exposures to the specific rodeo (rho = -0.8, P=0.01), indicating that bulls may become habituated to the rodeo environment. None of the factors evaluated were related to animal performance scores. In conclusion, few bulls show behavioural indicators of distress during the loading and holding period prior to performance at a large rodeo. There is a potential to improve the experience of the bulls as well as safety of both handlers and bulls, without affecting the quality of the arena performance, by modifying human behaviour to reduce balking during loading and improving the exposure to humans while bulls are held in the bucking chute.

The cages (0.5 m(2)) differed in the floor type (wire or plastic net) and in the presence or absence of gnawing sticks (white locust). The animals could move freely among the four cages through swing doors. Infrared video recording was performed once a week, the number of rabbits in each cage was counted every half an hour (48 times/day) during the 24 h video recording. Between ages 5 and 11 weeks the rabbits showed a preference towards the plastic net floor (16 rabbits/m(2), 62.5%; 12 rabbits/m(2), 76:5%; P < 0.001). Gnawing stick application significantly affected cage preference: 54.1% (16 rabbits/m(2)) or 53.1% (12 rabbits/m(2)) of the rabbits choose the enriched cages (P < 0.001). In experiment 2, the 5-week-old rabbits were placed either in cages (2 rabbits/0.12 m(2), n = 72) or pens (13 rabbits/0.86 m(2), n = 104) with 16 rabbits/m(2). The floor types were wire or plastic net, with the presence or absence of gnawing sticks on the walls. Video recordings were made at 6.5 and 10.5 weeks of age between 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. and between 11:00 p.m. and 05:00 a.m. Compared to cages, the rabbits housed in pens spent less time with resting (58% versus 67%) and more time with locomotion (6.7% versus 3.8%) but the frequency of aggressive behaviour (measured by the number of ear lesions) was also higher (0.14% versus 0.01%). In pens the application of gnawing sticks significantly decreased the frequency of ear injuries (0.05% versus 0.22%). The floor type did not affect any behavioural pattern (eating, drinking, movement, resting, comfort, social, investigatory) significantly. The main results showed that growing rabbits have a preference for plastic net floor and cages provided with gnawing sticks. The resting, locomotive and aggressive behaviour was modified by the housing system and the presence of gnawing sticks decreased the frequency of physical injuries. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

As turtles approached higher latitudes the following spring and summer, they assumed behaviours consistent with regular foraging activity and eventually settled in coastal areas off Canada and the northeastern USA. Behavioural patterns corresponding to various phases of the migratory cycle were consistent across multiple animals and were repeated within individuals that completed return movements to northern waters. We consider the potential biological significance of these patterns, including how turtle behaviour relates to predator avoidance, thermoregulation and prey distribution.",ROYAL SOC,AUG 7,2005,101098rspb20053110,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.","James, MC (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",1559844

Using the oxygen-sensitive species rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as a model, individual fish were recorded while moving freely between two sides of a test arena: one with normoxia and one with stepwise progressive hypoxia [80-30% dissolved oxygen (DO) air saturation]. The results demonstrated a gradual decrease in the total time spent in hypoxia starting at 80% DO air saturation. At this DO level, the avoidance of hypoxia could not be attributed to changes in spontaneous swimming speed, neither in normoxia nor in hypoxia. Reducing the DO level to 60% air saturation resulted in decreased spontaneous swimming speed in normoxia, yet the number of trips to the hypoxic side of the test arena remained unchanged. Moreover, data revealed increased average residence time per trip in normoxia at DO levels <= 60% air saturation and decreased average residence time per trip in hypoxia at DO levels <= 50% air saturation. Finally, the spontaneous swimming speed in hypoxia increased at DO levels <= 40% air saturation and the number of trips to hypoxia decreased at the 30% DO air saturation level. Thus, avoidance of the deepest hypoxia was connected with a reduced number of trips to hypoxia as well as decreased and increased spontaneous swimming speed in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. Collectively, the data support the conclusions that the mechanistic basis for avoidance of hypoxia may (1) not involve changes in swimming speed during mild hypoxia and (2) depend on the severity of hypoxia.

We experimentally examined the effect of kelp biomass on the aggregative behavior and movement of a front of green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis at a wave-exposed site on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. We varied kelp (Laminaria digitata and L. longicruris) abundance in 2 x 2 m plots adjacent to the front in 3 treatments: 50 % plant removal, and 100 % frond removal and unmanipulated control. In each treatment, we monitored the position of the front and urchin density at the leading edge over 24 d. The mean advance of the front in 24 d (2.27 m) did not differ between treatments, but urchin density was greatest in the control (74.9 urchins 0.25 m(-2)) and lower in whole plant (54.3) and frond (39.4) removal treatments. When urchin density was used as a covariate, front advance was inversely related to kelp biomass and greater in frond and plant removal treatments than in the control. Together, urchin density and kelp biomass explained 75 % of variation in front advance. These findings provide the first direct evidence that urchins redistribute themselves along a front to concentrate in patches of greatest food availability. Temporal variation in urchin density at the front was inversely correlated with wave height, and individual grazing rates increased with urchin density, which may explain seasonal variation in front dynamics observed in previous studies.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2007,103354meps329191,"Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada./Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS E3B 4J1, Canada./Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Fredericton, NB E3B 6E1, Canada.","Lauzon-Guay, JS (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.",10_3354_meps329191

More people express concerns about spending time in the forest, because of the possibility of encountering bears, and acceptance for the bear is decreasing. In this context, reliable information about the bear's normal behaviour during bear-human encounters is important. Here we describe the behaviour of brown bears when encountering humans on foot. During 2006-2009, we approached 30 adult (21 females, 9 males) GPS-collared bears 169 times during midday, using 1-minute positioning before, during and after the approach. Observer movements were registered with a handheld GPS. The approaches started 869 +/- 348 m from the bears, with the wind towards the bear when passing it at approximately 50 m. The bears were detected in 15% of the approaches, and none of the bears displayed any aggressive behaviour. Most bears (80%) left the initial site during the approach, going away from the observers, whereas some remained at the initial site after being approached (20%). Young bears left more often than older bears, possibly due to differences in experience, but the difference between ages decreased during the berry season compared to the pre-berry season. The flight initiation distance was longer for active bears (115 +/- 94 m) than passive bears (69 +/- 47 m), and was further affected by horizontal vegetation cover and the bear's age. Our findings show that bears try to avoid confrontations with humans on foot, and support the conclusions of earlier studies that the Scandinavian brown bear is normally not aggressive during encounters with humans.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,FEB 20,2012,101371journalpone0031699,"[Moen, Gro Kvelprud; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar; Sahlen, Veronica; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway./[Stoen, Ole-Gunnar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden./[Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway.","Moen, GK (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.",10_1371_journal_pone_0031699

Space allowance per pig in outdoor paddocks, straw yards and fully-slatted pens was 19.98, 1.63 and 0.55 m(2), respectively with a group size of 20. Pigs were fed ad libitum from an average of 30-80 kg liveweight. Pig behaviour was observed during daylight for a total of 6 h, using both individual (focal) and group (scan) sampling. There were relatively few differences in behaviour between genotypes, although the outdoor genotype spent a higher proportion of observations in straw yards and fully-slatted pens engaged in social activity (P < 0.05) compared to the indoor genotype. Pigs housed in straw yards spent significantly more time examining the floor and moving (P < 0.001), and significantly less time tail-biting (P < 0.01) compared to those housed in fully-slatted pens, where a larger proportion of observation time was spent lying inactive (P < 0.001). Pigs in outdoor paddocks spent a large proportion of observation time inside the shelter hut (0.69), where it was not possible to determine their behaviour, although rooting and exploring the floor was the most frequently observed behaviour when the pigs were outside. Interaction between genotype and housing system did not occur to any major degree. It was concluded that, for the housing systems used in this study, pig behaviour was enriched and welfare enhanced in straw yards compared to fully-slatted pens. Further research is needed, however, before any conclusions can be made regarding the behaviour of pigs in outdoor paddocks.

Using Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, we tested the hypotheses that behaviour affected use between and within habitats, hereafter referred to as macro-and microhabitats, respectively. We fitted GPS-enabled collars to fifteen buffalo and used the distances and turning angles between consecutive fixes to cluster the resulting data into resting, grazing, walking and relocating behaviours. Distance to water and six vegetation characteristic variables were recorded in sites used for each behaviour, except for relocating, which occurred too infrequently. We used multilevel binomial and multinomial logistic regressions to identify variables that characterised seasonally-preferred macrohabitats and microhabitats used for different behaviours. Our results showed that macrohabitat use was linked to behaviour, although this was least apparent during the rainy season, when resources were most abundant. Behaviour-related microhabitat use was less significant, but variation in forage characteristics could predict some behaviour within all macrohabitats. The variables predicting behaviour were not consistent, but resting and grazing sites were more readily identifiable than walking sites. These results highlight the significance of resting, as well as foraging, site availability in buffalo spatial processes. Our results emphasise the importance of considering several behaviours and scales in studies of habitat use to understand the links between environmental resources and animal behavioural and spatial ecology.",NA,DEC 16,2015,101371journalpone0145145,NA,NA,10_1371_journal_pone_0145145

Thirty wells were investigated in April and July 2012, and September 2013. These surveys resulted in the capture of 58 individuals from eight wells and comprised three to 14 individuals per well. The capture of the individuals allowed a detailed evaluation of their colours in life, behaviour in the field and in captivity, aspects of their biology, confirmation of the species identification and provided new diagnostic characteristics to distinguish between P. sanguijuela and Phreatobius dracunculus. Cannibalism, territorialism, agonistic interactions and phototaxis behaviour were not observed. Phreatobius sanguijuela exhibited cryptobiotic habits and two behaviours under stressful conditions. The analysis of stomach contents reveals that this species apparently feeds on invertebrates, almost exclusively on earthworms. The sex ratio was 1:1. The absence of opercular movement during the resting period associated with intense blood irrigation of the skin indicates a possible cutaneous respiration as an alternative form of gas exchange. Local people often mistake P. sanguijuela for helminths and have the habit of releasing non-native fishes into the wells or to use chemicals to eliminate them. The consequence of this habit for the conservation of the species requires further evaluation. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",WILEY,AUG,2016,101111jfb13037,"[Ohara, W.

Roberts, J. A.",NA,NA,NA,"It is important to understand how wild-caught animals may respond to captivity, and whether their behaviours in captivity are reflective of their wild counterparts. We observed the behaviour of wild-caught western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus; formerly M. rufus) that were transferred to a large naturally vegetated enclosure. Observations were made on the first day of captivity and again after 7-10 days, and were compared with the behaviour of free-living kangaroos at the same locality and over the same period. We quantified feeding, moving, grooming and non-alert behaviours. Of these, grooming was higher in captive kangaroos than in free-living animals on the first day of captivity only, and was no different to that of wild animal by 7-10 days' captivity. Such self-directed behaviour may be indicative of heightened distress for kangaroos on the first day of captivity, but it may also be indicative of grooming to eliminate contamination of human smells or debris following capture by darting and recovery. Overall, our findings indicate that after a short period of captivity, wild-caught kangaroos adjust to a novel environment relatively quickly, and animals from each species showed behaviour patterns comparable with free-ranging counterparts within 7-10 days after capture and captivity.",NA,NA,2017,101071AM16019,NA,NA,NA

Density-dependence","Ecological theory suggests that the behaviour, growth and abundance of predators will be strongly influenced by the abundance of prey. Predators may in turn play an important role in structuring prey populations and communities. Responses of predators to variation in prey abundance have most commonly been demonstrated in low-diversity communities where food webs are relatively simple. How predators respond in highly diverse assemblages such as in coral reef habitats is largely unknown. This study describes an experiment that examined how the movement, diet and growth of the coral reef piscivore, Cephalopholis boenak (Serranidae) responded to variation in the abundance of its prey. Predator densities were standardised on small patch reefs made from the lagoonal reef-building coral, Porites cylindrica. These patch reefs exhibited natural variation in the abundance and community structure of multiple species of prey. However, our experiment generated a relatively simple predator-prey relationship, with C. boenak primarily responding to the most abundant species of prey. Three responses of predators were observed: aggregative, functional and developmental. Thirty-one per cent of individuals moved between patch reefs during the experiment, all from areas of relatively low to high prey density. Feeding rates were higher on patch reefs of high prey density, while growth rates of fish that remained on low prey density reefs throughout the experiment were lower. Growth rates of C. boenak on the experimental reefs were also much higher than for those living on natural patch reefs over the same time period, corresponding with overall differences in prey abundance. These results suggest that local abundance, feeding rate and growth of C. boenak were closely linked to the abundance of their main prey. This combination of predatory responses is a potential mechanism behind recent observations of density-dependent mortality and population regulation of prey in coral reef fish communities.",SPRINGER,SEP,2011,101007s0033801107929,"[Beukers-Stewart, B.

The animals were instrumented with data loggers recording heart rate, dive depth, and swimming activity, and then released into a 1,200 m(3) net-cage in the ocean. The exposure consisted of three different 1-s sonar signals covering the 1 to 7 kHz band transmitted either by using 10-s inter-ping intervals and gradually increasing source level from 134 to 194 dBRMS (re 1 mu Pa @ 1 m) within 6 min, or using the maximum source level of 194 dBRMS from the first ping but gradually decreasing the inter-ping intervals from 100 s to 10 s within 10 min (duty cycle increasing from 1 to 10%). Transmission loss from the source to the animal varied from 10 to 27 dB, depending on the exact location within the net-cage and the transmitted frequency. The animals responded to the initial (10% duty cycle) exposure with avoidance to signals above 160 to 170 dBRMS (re 1 mu Pa) received levels. This involved reduced diving activity, commencement of rapid exploratory swimming at surface, and eventually displacement to areas of least sound pressure level. However, already upon the second exposure, the initial rapid swimming activity was absent, while the reduction in diving activity became even more pronounced. No differences were found in behavioural response to different transmitted frequencies. Increased heart rate at the surface indicates emotional activation during sonar exposure, but lack of effect of sonar exposure on heart rate during diving indicates that physiological responses to diving remain intact.",EUROPEAN ASSOC AQUATIC MAMMALS,NA,2010,101578AM3632010239,"[Kvadsheim, Petter H.; Sevaldsen, Erik M.] Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, Maritime Syst Div, Horten, Norway./[Folkow, Lars P.; Blix, Arnoldus S.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.","Kvadsheim, PH (reprint author), Norwegian Def Res Estab FFI, Maritime Syst Div, Horten, Norway.",NA

Such discharge may create barriers to movement, potentially affecting migration of fish and invertebrate species, including commercial species. Avoidance of such discharges by adults may affect spawning migrations, while similar behaviour by juveniles may affect migration to nursery habitats. As a result, the capacity of fish to access important habitats beyond the discharge point may be reduced with potential consequences for stock size. This study examined the possible existence of acid sulfate avoidance behaviour in juveniles of 3 commercial fish species and 1 commercial prawn species. Schools of 10 individuals were given a simultaneous choice between 2 different water qualities in paired channels of a laboratory stream, i.e. preference -avoidance situation. All species avoided acidified water, indicating that chronic acid sulfate discharge has the potential to affect migration of these species in the field.

Behavioural data was collected during boat surveys using scan sampling of groups and focal individual follows of 5 female dolphins with calves. The movement patterns of dolphin groups were not affected by the presence of a few (1 to 2) tourist boats without swimmers. However, the groups displayed a significantly larger proportion of erratic (non-directional) movements as tourist activities increased and when swimmers were present. The proportion of active, peduncle, tail-out and porpoise dives also increased as tourist activity increased. Further, females travelled more frequently as tourist activities increased; this may have a negative effect on the time available for females to nurse their calves. Intense non-regulated dolphin tourism in this area may lead to a shift in habitat use by nursing females, and the apparent changes in dolphin behaviour due to the increased levels of tourism may ultimately reduce fitness at both individual and population levels.

Individual behaviour, group aggregation and behavioural synchrony were compared at 1, 5 and 9 weeks of age (experiment 1) and in the parents of these chicks at 9-13 months of age (experiment 2). Responses to visual and physical isolation were assessed at 1,5 and 9 weeks.
Analyses of home-pen behaviour showed that both rdd and beg had difficulty locating or consuming food during the first week of life. WL and rdd did not engage in abnormal behaviour (circle walking, air pecking, star gazing) at 1, 5 and 9 weeks whereas both beg and rdd adults did so. At 9 weeks beg and rdd birds showed decreased behavioural synchrony compared with WL, whereas group aggregation in rdd and WL was similar and higher than in beg. WL adults showed increased environmental pecking and higher rates of behavioural synchrony and group aggregation than both beg and rdd. Under visual isolation from conspecifics rdd chicks behaved like blind birds in some respects (e.g. decreased movement) and as sighted birds in others (e.g. peeping). The vision of rdd was apparently diminished compared with sighted controls (WL) even from an early age.
It was concluded that abnormal behaviours are a response to a complete loss of vision regardless of initial sight. Birds that became blind during rearing (rdd) may be more active as adults than birds that were blind throughout life but in general the behaviour of blind birds was similar regardless of early sight.

The understanding of mechanisms leading to group cohesion is essential for understanding the collective dynamics of groups and the spatio-temporal distribution of organisms in environment. In this view, social aggregation in terrestrial isopods represents an interesting model due to its recurrence both in the field and in the laboratory. In this study, and under a perturbation context, we experimentally tested the stability of groups of woodlice according to group size and time spent in group. Our results indicate that the response to the disturbance of groups decreases with increases in these two variables. Models neglecting social effects cannot reproduce experimental data, attesting that cohesion of aggregation in terrestrial isopods is partly governed by a social effect. In particular, models involving calmed and excited individuals and a social transition between these two behavioural states more accurately reproduced our experimental data. Therefore, we concluded that group cohesion (and collective response to stimulus) in terrestrial isopods is governed by a transitory resting state under the influence of density of conspecifics and time spent in group.

Females with cubs are often involved when humans are injured by brown bears Ursus arctos. In Scandinavia, this is particularly true for unarmed recreational forest users. Our aim was to document behavioural differences between single bears and females with cubs in order to develop recommendations to minimize the risk of injuries to recreational forest users. We documented the reactions of GPS-collared females with cubs and single brown bears to experimental approaches by humans to 50 m from the bear on 42 and 108 occasions, respectively. The majority of females with cubs (95%) and single bears (89%) left when approached. Bears that left were passed at shorter distances and were in more open areas than those that stayed. Both groups had similar flight initiation distances, which were longer for bears that were active at the time of the disturbance. Females with cubs selected more open habitat than single bears, also for the new site they selected following disturbance. Females with cubs, particularly active females with cubs of the year, moved greater distances and spent more time active following the approach. Females with cubs and single bears were seen or heard in 26% and 14% of the approaches, respectively. None of the bears displayed any aggressive behaviour during the approaches. Females with cubs selected more open habitat, perhaps predisposing them to encountering people that are not involved in hunting activities, which might be the primary explanation why females with cubs are most frequently involved when unarmed people are injured by bears in Scandinavia. To mitigate injury risks, one must consider factors that bring bears closer to human activity in the first place.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,APR 1,2015,101371journalpone0121576,"[Sahlen, Veronica; Ordiz, Andres; Swenson, Jon E.; Stoen, Ole Gunnar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway./[Ordiz, Andres] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden./[Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway./[Stoen, Ole Gunnar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.","Sahlen, V (reprint author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, As, Norway.",10_1371_journal_pone_0121576

Due to their high historical, and sometimes present-day, abundances, capability for large-scale movements and high metabolic rates, they have the potential to affect the structure and function of ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms over both ecological and evolutionary time. Usually, the effects of marine mammals on ecosystems are explicitly or implicitly considered to occur through their ability to remove prey through direct predation. Recent empirical studies and a rich theoretical framework, however, demonstrate that marine mammals can affect ecosystems through more diverse pathways, including those that are driven by marine mammal behaviour. Thus, non-consumptive effects of and on marine mammals may be critical in shaping their ecological importance. Non-consumptive effects may include risk effects, whereby predators induce costly changes to prey behaviour that impact prey population sizes or the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of prey impacts on communities (e.g. behaviour-mediated trophic cascades). Changes in the abundance of large apex predators (both marine mammals and sharks) and the introduction of perceived and real risks (human disturbance) may also affect behaviours of marine mammals and their prey that cascade to the wider ecosystem; the conditions under which such cascading effects might be most important, however, remain poorly understood. Other behaviour-driven ecological roles of marine mammals may include foraging tactics that facilitate the foraging of other species (especially seabirds), translocating nutrients and linking the dynamics of spatially distinct food webs.",INTER-RESEARCH,MAR 16,2015,103354meps11180,"[Kiszka, Jeremy J.; Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, North Miami, FL 33181 USA./[Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","Kiszka, JJ (reprint author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",NA

Despite evidence for behavioural flexibility in other taxa, previous research on large mammals has often assumed that migratory behaviour is a fixed behavioural trait. Migratory behaviour may be plastic for many species, although few studies have tested for individual-level flexibility using long-term monitoring of marked individuals, especially in large mammals such as ungulates. We tested variability in individual migratory behaviour using a 10-year telemetry data set of 223 adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) in the partially migratory Ya Ha Tinda population in Alberta, Canada. We used net squared displacement (NSD) to classify migratory strategy for each individual elk-year. Individuals switched between migrant and resident strategies at a mean rate of 15% per year, and migrants were more likely to switch than residents. We then tested how extrinsic (climate, elk/wolf abundance) and intrinsic (age) factors affected the probability of migrating, and, secondly, the decision to switch between migratory strategies. Over 630 individual elk-years, the probability of an individual elk migrating increased following a severe winter, in years of higher wolf abundance, and with increasing age. At an individual elk level, we observed 148 switching events of 430 possible transitions in elk monitored at least 2years. We found switching was density-dependent, where migrants switched to a resident strategy at low elk abundance, but residents switched more to a migrant strategy at high elk abundance. Precipitation during the previous summer had a weak carryover effect, with migrants switching slightly more following wetter summers, whereas residents showed the opposite pattern. Older migrant elk rarely switched, whereas resident elk switched more frequently to migrate at older ages. Our results show migratory behaviour in ungulates is an individually variable trait that can respond to intrinsic, environmental and density-dependent forces. Different strategies had opposing responses to density-dependent and intrinsic drivers, providing a stabilizing mechanism for the maintenance of partial migration and demographic fitness in this population.",WILEY,MAY,2016,1.01111136526561E+018,"[Eggeman, Scott L.; Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA./[Bohm, Holger; Merrill, Evelyn H.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada./[Whittington, Jesse] Banff Natl Pk, Parks Canada, Resource Conservat, Banff, AB, Canada.","Hebblewhite, M (reprint author), Univ Montana, Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",NA

Most fishes tended to orient their bodies parallel to oncoming wave-driven flow and recruited additional stabilising fins during rough weather; such changes in swimming behaviour aid stability and minimise drag. However, not all species displayed such flexibility, with fishes possessing highly tapered pectoral fins and high levels of swimming performance continuing to successfully navigate reef habitats without significantly altering their swimming behaviour.

However, objectively interpreting behavioural information from the large volumes of highly detailed data collected by such devices can be challenging. We combined three biologging technologies-global positioning system (GPS), saltwater immersion and time-depth recorders-to build a detailed picture of the at-sea behaviour of the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) during the breeding season. We used a hidden Markov model to explore discrete states within the combined GPS and immersion data, and found that behaviour could be organized into three principal activities representing (i) sustained direct flight, (ii) sitting on the sea surface, and (iii) foraging, comprising tortuous flight interspersed with periods of immersion. The additional logger data verified that the foraging activity corresponded well to the occurrence of diving. Applying this approach to a large tracking dataset revealed that birds from two different colonies foraged in local waters that were exclusive, but overlapped in one key area: the Irish Sea Front (ISF). We show that the allocation of time to each activity differed between colonies, with birds breeding furthest from the ISF spending the greatest proportion of time engaged in direct flight and the smallest proportion of time engaged in foraging activity.

Spatio-temporal analyses revealed differences in activity patterns and interactions within and between the species. Interference competition occurred in all intraspecific and interspecific comparisons tested. Encounter competition was judged to be the mechanism operating as all animals entered into interactions with other individuals. Encounters were particularly prevalent within Antechinus, indicating that they were more social than the relatively solitary Sminthopsis. Avoidance behaviour occurred between the two Antechinus species and this may enable them to coexist, so that this mechanism may be considered to be avoidance competition. The smaller competitor, S. murina, showed avoidance of the larger A. stuartii.

Intake mechanisms","The relationship between herbage intake by herbivores and herbage available depends on the interaction between sward structure and animal behaviour. This relationship is a crucial component determining the stability, function and productivity of grazing systems. The present study aims at quantifying the mechanisms by which intake rate is determined in swards of contrasting structure and forage species, and it reveals the importance of animal choice in the interaction between animal and sward. We hypothesised that as sward height and herbage mass increased, bite mass and intake rate would increase. The relationship between intake rate and bite mass should exhibit a higher asymptote for the more succulent, less fibrous Avena than for Cynodon due to differences in chewing requirements per unit dry mass of intake. In four different experiments, Cynodon sp. cv. Tifton 85 and Avena strigosa cv. Iapar 61 swards of different heights were obtained by various durations of short time high-intensity grazing or by different growth periods. Bite mass and intake rate were estimated by the double-weighing technique with correction for insensible losses. Number and timing of jaw movements and bites were measured with behaviour recorders. Bite mass was the main variable determining intake rate. Contrary to expectations, bite mass first increased and then decreased with increasing sward height, a result that seems due to animal choice and not from restrictions imposed by the swards. As expected, Cynodon sp. swards required more chewing per unit DM intake due to their higher DM content (39.5 vs. 22.6, P <0.0001) and higher fibre (67.8 vs. 51.3, P <0.0001) content than A. strigosa. Harvesting and chewing jaw movements, the components of total jaw movements and time per bite, had different time costs, and values were remarkably similar to previously published values. On average, each harvesting jaw movement took 1 s and a chewing jaw movement took 0.68 s. The reduction in bite mass with increasing sward height in tall swards is discussed as a destabilising mechanism that generates spatial heterogeneity in sward height and mass. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Both species were subjected to the specific risk of predation by the native rock lobster Jasus lalandii and the general risk of predation simulated by the presence of damaged conspecifics. We hypothesised that, because M galloprovincialis evolved in allopatry from the rock lobster, P. perna would respond more strongly to J, lalandii, but that there would be less difference between species in their response to damaged conspecifics. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses. M galloprovincialis crawled farther under both predation treatments and generally aggregated more than P. perna. P. pema has a larger foot, and our results therefore do not reflect morphological differences between the species but imply greater sensitivity in M galloprovincialis to chemical cues. Crawling distance was not enhanced under predation threat relative to the control; therefore, increased clumping due to more rapid random movement cannot explain our results, indicating that chemical attraction among individuals is important. P. perna clumping behaviour was significantly greater when exposed to local lobster effluent or damaged conspecifics, whereas M galloprovincialis clumped more when exposed to a general threat of predation but exhibited naive behaviour to local predator effluent. This lack of responsiveness to a native predator could be due not only to the recent arrival of the European mussel, but also to the relatively low selective effects of predation in South Africa.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2007,103354meps336169,"Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.","Nicastro, KR (reprint author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",10_3354_meps336169

Contrary to our predictions, brown bears responded with a somewhat calmer response than moose, illustrating response differences in large herbivores and carnivores.

One strategy is area-restricted search, in which individuals interrupt straight-line motion on detecting prey, and then circle about. This increased rate of turning near prey increases the likelihood of detecting additional patches, since patches tend to be clumped in space. A second strategy is local enhancement, in which individuals monitor the behaviour of others, and converge on those individuals that display behaviour indicative of feeding. In this paper, attention is focused on the first strategy, area restricted search, and evidence of increased turning rates in the vicinity of krill patches is sought. The hypotheses tested were first, that six species of krill-feeding petrels engage in area restricted search; and then that the tendency for seabirds to either sit on the water, patter with their feet, or seize prey was correlated with the distance to the nearest krill patch. Seabird abundance and behaviour was paired with krill abundance east of South Georgia (55 degrees S, 35 degrees W) in June 1993. Three species, Cape Petrel Daption capense, Northern Giant Petrel Macronectes halli and Southern Giant Petrel M. giganteus, changed their direction of Eight significantly more often when near krill swarms than when in krill-free areas, indicating that they used area restricted search.

Since the generalist predator Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) can affect the temporal and spatial dynamics of slugs, we investigated whether the slug Deroceras reticulatum responds to chemical cues from these beetles. We recorded the movements of slugs in arenas incorporating both a zone containing paper upon which the predatory beetles had been maintained and a control zone. Significantly more slugs accumulated on the control half of arenas after 24 h, with small slugs being quickest to respond. Slugs avoided paper exposed to both male and female beetles. They did not respond to paper that had been exposed to beetles and then stored for 5 days before the test. Slugs moved faster, turned less, spent proportionately more time moving and spent less time overall on paper exposed to male beetles than on control paper. This is consistent with a kinesis that would enable the slugs to escape rapidly from areas where predators were present. We conclude that slugs have evolved behavioural responses to chemical cues from either this generalist carabid predator in particular, or carabid beetles generally, many species of which include molluscs in their diets.

PATTERNS; FOREST; TIMER; FIELD",population estimation; trappability; activity patterns,"Context. The behavioural response of animals to repeated trapping has implications for correction of population and monitoring indices that use catch per unit effort. Failure to account for sprung traps introduces biases into estimates of relative abundance. The time when animals get caught in live traps is often ignored, but it can provide important information about temporal movement patterns relevant to this issue.
Aims. We assessed changes in the behaviour of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), a nocturnal marsupial, in response to repeated trapping and evaluated the potential benefit of correcting a commonly used index of abundance by using time-of-capture information.
Methods. Possums were live-trapped for three nights each month over a 20-month period in baited cage traps in a 6-ha area of native lowland forest in the southern North Island, New Zealand. Trapped possums were individually identified on first capture. Timing devices were attached to the traps to measure how long after sunset traps were sprung and how that time related to the duration of the trap-night (sunset to sunrise).
Key results. Possums were trapped, on average, similar to 1.25 h after sunset. Traps triggered other than by possums were sprung on average 1-2 h later. Possums caught on the first night of a trapping session were caught significantly earlier than those caught on subsequent nights. Previous capture influenced the time of subsequent capture in a trapping session in complex ways, and recapture times were generally earlier than times of first capture. Possums were captured, on average, after 11% of the duration of a trap-night and traps were triggered by animals other than possums, on average, after 22% of the duration of a trap-night.
Conclusions. The data on time of capture of possums and triggering of sprung traps suggested a need to alter the commonly used correction factor for population indices for possums, because, on average, traps were sprung for significantly more of each trapping interval (i.e. trap-night) than the half a trap-night assumed in the correction factor.
Implications. Better understanding of possum foraging behaviour is a key to more effective control using traps. In that context, more research is needed to understand the reasons for individual differences in trappability. Although it is theoretically desirable to account for sprung traps when trapping is used to index populations, to reduce biases in estimates of relative abundance, correction of the standardised residual trap-catch index for possums is probably unimportant in practical terms, because most possum control reduces numbers to levels (2-5% trap catch) at which correction of the index is unimportant. The principal exception to this is likely to be when there is a high level of non-target interference from rodents.",CSIRO PUBLISHING,NA,2012,101071WR11127,"[Cowan, Phil] Landcare Res, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand./[Forrester, Guy] Landcare Res, Lincoln 8152, New Zealand.","Cowan, P (reprint author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 11052, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",NA

We investigated the response of Diana monkeys to increased predation risk by looking at behavioural changes associated with male long-distance calls, which are reliably given to certain predators. After male long-distance calls, group spread and nearest-neighbour distance decreased whilst travel and association rates for the group increased. The average height and exposure level of individuals in the group did not change after calls. Individual Diana monkeys changed their behaviour and were more likely to be vigilant or travel and less likely to engage in social or resting behaviours after long-distance calls. In addition, movement rates increased with the number of species the Diana monkeys were associated with. Diana monkey long-distance calls facilitate the joining of groups of other species. Black and white colobus and lesser spot-nosed monkeys were more likely to be in an association following a long-distance call than before. Behavioural responses, such as increased travel or association rates, that reduce foraging efficiency are interpreted as evidence of a non-lethal impact of increased predation risk.",SPRINGER,MAR,2003,101007s002650020575y,"Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England./Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France./Univ Strasbourg 1, CNRS UPR 9010, CEPE, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.","Shultz, S (reprint author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol, Biosci Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZB, Merseyside, England.",10_1007_s00265_002_0575_y

MODEL",NA,"Background: Commercial viewing and swimming with dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) near Kaikoura, New Zealand began in the late 1980s and researchers have previously described changes in vocalisation, aerial behaviour, and group spacing in the presence of vessels. This study was conducted to assess the current effects that tourism has on the activity budget of dusky dolphins to provide wildlife managers with information for current decision-making and facilitate development of quantitative criteria for management of this industry in the future.
Methodology/Principal Findings: First-order time discrete Markov chain models were used to assess changes in the behavioural state of dusky dolphin pods targeted by tour vessels. Log-linear analysis was conducted on behavioural state transitions to determine whether the likelihood of dolphins moving from one behavioural state to another changed based on natural and anthropogenic factors. The best-fitting model determined by Akaike Information Criteria values included season, time of day, and vessel presence within 300 m. Interactions with vessels reduced the proportion of time dolphins spent resting in spring and summer and increased time spent milling in all seasons except autumn. Dolphins spent more time socialising in spring and summer, when conception occurs and calves are born, and the proportion of time spent resting was highest in summer. Resting decreased and traveling increased in the afternoon.
Conclusions/Significance: Responses to tour vessel traffic are similar to those described for dusky dolphins elsewhere. Disturbance linked to vessels may interrupt social interactions, carry energetic costs, or otherwise affect individual fitness. Research is needed to determine if increased milling is a result of acoustic masking of communication due to vessel noise, and to establish levels at which changes to behavioural budgets of dusky dolphins are likely to cause long-term harm. Threshold values from these studies would allow managers to set appropriate operational conditions based on quantifiable criteria.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUL 23,2012,101371journalpone0041969,"[Lundquist, David; Gemmell, Neil J.] Univ Otago, Dept Anat, Dunedin, New Zealand./[Wuersig, Bernd] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.","Lundquist, D (reprint author), Univ Otago, Dept Anat, Dunedin, New Zealand.",10_1371_journal_pone_0041969

In 53% of all hunts, deer left their normal home ranges within 24 hours, moving on average 4 km and remaining away for an average of six days. Compared to pre-hunt values, deer moved longer distances per unit time on the day of the hunt and during the following two nights. Diurnal activity (based on motion sensors) did not increase significantly on the hunting day, but was lower than normal the day after the hunt. Nocturnal activity was equal before and after hunts. Deer spent 96% of their time in (safer) forest habitats by day and 43% by night before and after hunts. No induced responses were conditional on distance to the hunters (0-1.5 km) hunt duration (1.3-6.4 hours) or the time elapsed since previous hunts (4 to > 30 days).

Recent technological advances include intra-abdominally implanted archival telemetry devices for the life-long monitoring of individual animals. No research to date has assessed any aspect of post-operative pain in marine mammals. This study specifically evaluated behavioural responses in nine juvenile Steller sea lions to the abdominal surgery required for insertion of telemetry devices. Behaviours predicted to reflect post-operative pain, including posture and body movements, were assessed during 3-day pre-, 3-day post-, and days 10-12 post-surgery. The proportion of time sea lions spent on land standing increased from 0.00 to 0.07 and then decreased to 0.04, for pre-, post-, and late post-surgery respectively. Similarly, the proportion of land time spent with the back arched increased from 0.01 to 0.57, and then decreased to 0.33. The time sea lions spent on land with pressure on their ventral side while sitting or lying down declined from 1.0 pre-surgery to 0.17 post-surgery, and increased to 0.20 late post-surgery. The time sea lions spent in locomotion on land and in the water decreased from 0.05 in pre-surgery to 0.01 post-surgery, and returned to 0.06 by late post-surgery. These results suggest that behaviours such as back arch, standing, time spent with pressure on the ventral side, and locomotion may be useful in the assessment of pain following abdominal surgery in sea lions. The presence of these behaviours and their persistence for LIP to 12 days after surgery suggest that more work is required to further develop safe and effective analgesic methods for this procedure.

Physiological and human self-report data suggest that CO(2) may cause pain and dyspnea, a sensation of breathlessness and increased respiratory effort, at the concentrations used for gradual-fill euthanasia. However, previous studies examining the behavioural responses of rats have reported conflicting results. In this study, detailed behavioural responses of rats were examined during gradual-fill CO(2) euthanasia and during gradual-fill with argon to produce a similar reduction in oxygen concentration. Animals were randomly allocated to the CO(2) or reduced oxygen treatment groups (n = 8 for both), and were first tested with air exposure and then with treatment gas exposure on the following day. Observations were taken for 105 s before and after gas flow began (baseline and exposure periods), as animals had ceased purposeful movement within 105 s of CO(2) flow starting. Behavioural changes from baseline during gas exposure were compared to changes during air exposure on control days. In comparison to air exposure, CO(2) resulted in increased activity, rearing, touching the nose to the chamber lid, escape behaviours and vocalizations. A small increase in touching the nose to the chamber lid was observed when oxygen concentrations were reduced with argon, but no other behavioural changes were observed. These results suggest that gradual-fill CO(2) euthanasia causes distress in rats, and that hypoxia alone is not a major cause of this distress. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This species can employ physiological mechanisms that allow it to cope with acute hypoxic episodes. When crabs feed there is a general increase in physiological variables; these may pose an additional physiological burden on crabs already attempting to maintain adequate oxygen uptake in hypoxia. In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, the inshore habitats of C. magister ranged in dissolved oxygen from 28 kPa at the water surface to less than 1.0 kPa just above the sediment-water interface. During short-term hypoxic events, crabs reduced both the amount of food eaten and the amount of time spent feeding. Crabs tended to cease feeding below 3.2 kPa oxygen, but resumed feeding when the dissolved oxygen tensions were rapidly raised to 6 kPa. In a high (10.5-21 kPa) oxygen gradient, both unfed and fed crabs showed no preference for any area of the gradient. In a low (2.5-10.5 kPa) dissolved oxygen gradient, both unfed and fed crabs preferred the highest oxygen regime. In the laboratory, crabs were less likely to enter hypoxic waters (below 3.2 kPa oxygen) to obtain and consume food; those that did moved the food to a higher oxygen regime prior to feeding and settled in higher oxygen regimes for digestion. Crab behaviour was also monitored in the field. Fed and unfed crabs were fitted with ultrasonic telemetry tags and tracked during a tidal cycle. Unfed crabs remained mobile, travelling up to 1,370 m within 6 h, while postprandial crabs settled in areas of high oxygen and moved very little during the first 48 h after release. The present study suggests that C. magister exhibits behavioural responses in order to minimise the use of physiological mechanisms, and maximise foraging and digestive processes. Thus the nutritional state of the individual may be important in regulating both its behaviour and distribution in its natural environment.",SPRINGER,FEB,2007,101007s0022700603923,"Univ Nevada, Dept Biol Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA./Univ Florida, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA./Univ Nevada, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA./Bamfield Marine Sci Ctr, Bamfield, BC V0R 1B0, Canada.","Mcgaw, IJ (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Dept Biol Sci, 4505 Maryland Pkway, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",10_1007_s00227_006_0392_3

The contents of Hg, Cu and Cd in T. saltator tissues were measured at the end of pre-exposure to contaminated seawater and after 7 days of exposure to contaminated sand. Substrate selection tests were carried out in a binary choice arena. Tests in contaminated sand showed that sandhopper locomotor activity varied in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Cu and Hg (at lower Hg concentration they were more active during daytime) but did not show significant changes in Cd-exposed animals except for disappearance of the typical circadian activity pattern. Pre-exposure to trace metals in seawater induced a significant decrease of movements for all metals, although the effects varied according to the toxicity of the metal. Trace metals analyses showed that tissue concentrations of Hg, Cu and Cd were related to their concentrations in the test medium. Substrate selection tests showed avoidance of contaminated sand only when sandhoppers were tested in the presence of both concentrations of Hg and at the higher concentration of Cu.

This study examined the effectiveness of efforts to minimize the behavioural responses of the whales to vessel proximity and sound during the survey. Two shore-based behavioural observation teams monitored whale movements and respirations pre-, during and post-seismic survey. Theodolite tracking and focal-animal follow methods were used to collect behavioural data. Mixed linear models were used to examine deviations from 'normal' patterns in 10 movement and 7 respiration response variables in relation to vessel proximity, vessel/whale relative orientations and 8 received sound metrics to examine if seismic survey sound and/or vessel activity influenced the whales' behaviour. Behavioural state and water depth were the best 'natural' predictors of whale movements and respiration. After considering natural variation, none of the response variables were significantly associated with seismic survey or vessel sounds. A whale's distance from shore and its orientation relative to the closest vessel were found to be significantly influenced by vessel proximity, which suggested some non-sound related disturbance. The lack of evidence that the whales responded to seismic survey sound and vessel traffic by changing either their movement or respiration patterns could indicate that the current mitigation strategy is effective. However, power analyses suggest that our sample sizes were too small to detect subtle to moderate changes in gray whale behaviour.",NA,NA,2016,103354esr00713,NA,NA,10_3354_esr00713

We examined the behavioural responses of sharks to capture by attaching accelerometers to fishing gear and measuring the immediate and prolonged forces they exerted while on the line. We recorded acceleration vectors and derived the rate of intense fighting behaviours of 23 individual sharks comprising three species. Results suggest that blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) exhibited intense bouts of fighting behaviour at the onset of hooking, while nurse (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) displayed more subdued acceleration values during capture. We also obtained plasma lactate from a subset of individuals and detected a strong correlation with maximum acceleration.

Seasonal mass change is an important fitness correlate of large herbivores and affects reproductive success of female moose.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Using GPS-collared adult female moose from two populations in southern Norway we quantified individual differences in seasonal activity budget and resource selection patterns as a function of seasonal temperatures thought to induce heat stress in moose. Individual body mass was recorded in early and late winter, and autumn to calculate seasonal mass changes (n = 52 over winter, n = 47 over summer). We found large individual differences in temperature-dependent resource selection patterns as well as within and between season variability in thermoregulatory strategies. As expected, individuals using an optimal strategy, selecting young successional forest (foraging habitat) at low ambient temperatures and mature coniferous forest (thermal shelter) during thermally stressful conditions, lost less mass in winter and gained more mass in summer.
Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that behavioural responses to temperature have important consequences for seasonal mass change in moose living in the south of their distribution in Norway, and may be a contributing factor to recently observed declines in moose demographic performance. Although the mechanisms that underlie the observed temperature mediated habitat-fitness relationship remain to be tested, physiological state and individual variation in thermal tolerance are likely contributory factors. Climate-related effects on animal behaviour, and subsequently fitness, are expected to intensify as global warming continues.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,JUN 11,2013,101371journalpone0065972,"[van Beest, Floris M.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Coll Agr & Bioresources, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada./[van Beest, Floris M.; Milner, Jos M.] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, Evenstad, Norway.","van Beest, FM (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Coll Agr & Bioresources, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",10_1371_journal_pone_0065972

Seasonal migration is a striking example of coordinated behaviour, enabling animal populations to track spatio-temporal variation in ecological conditions. By contrast, for dispersal, while social context may influence an individual's emigration and settlement decisions, transience is believed to be mostly a solitary behaviour. Here, we review differences in drivers that may explain why migration appears to be more synchronized than dispersal. We derive the prediction that the contrast in the importance of behavioural synchronization between dispersal and migration is linked to differences in the selection pressures that drive their respective evolution. Although documented examples of collective dispersal are rare, this behaviour may be more common than currently believed, with important consequences for eco-evolutionary dynamics. Crucially, to date, there is little available theory for predicting when we should expect collective dispersal to evolve, and we also lack empirical data to test predictions across species. By reviewing the state of the art in research on migration and collective movements, we identify how we can harness these advances, both in terms of theory and data collection, to broaden our understanding of synchronized dispersal and its importance in the context of global change.",WILEY,AUG,2017,101111brv12279,"[Cote, Julien] ENFA, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France./[Cote, Julien] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, CNRS, UMR 5174, EDB,Lab Evolut & Diversite Biol, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France./[Bocedi, Greta; Travis, Justin] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland./[Debeffe, Lucie; Gonzalez, Georges; Hewison, A.

behaviour","Thermoregulatory behaviours are of great importance for ectotherms buffering against the impact of temperature extremes. Such behaviours bring not only benefits but also organism level costs such as decreased food availability and foraging efficiency and thus lead to energetic costs and metabolic consequences. However, there remains an important gap in our knowledge to link thermoregulatory behaviour to population level ecological consequences. Aphids, as ectothermic invertebrates, can escape from thermal extremes by either dropping off the plant they are on or moving to suitable microclimates. Here we used the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, as a model system to test the hypothesis that aphids may behaviourally avoid heat stress while also altering their microhabitat utilization leading to demographic consequences. We found that heat stress drove the aphids to leave their host plant; this reduction in host plant residence was associated with increasing leaf temperatures indicating that aphids exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour to escape heat stress. Specifically, we found that behavioural thermoregulation made the aphids disperse and redistribute themselves within different microclimates and thus led to changes in microhabitat utilization. We also discovered that leaving the host plant during behavioural thermoregulation resulted in a considerable decrease in aphids' survival probability due to their inefficient relocation to other plants and increased risk of starvation. Finally, we found that the aphids' thermoregulatory behaviour prevented heat stress while concurrently resulting in decreased survival and reproduction. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation alters microhabitat utilization and demographic rates in aphids. This study highlights the importance of behavioural thermoregulation and its ecological consequences and has important implications for understanding population responses in the context of current climate change.

Our objectives were to determine movement of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) that use thermal refuge and project differences in growth and consumption among smallmouth bass exhibiting different thermal-use patterns. We implanted radio transmitters in 29 smallmouth bass captured in Alley Spring on the Jacks Fork River, Missouri, USA, during the winter of 2012. Additionally, temperature archival tags were implanted in a subset of nine fish. Fish were tracked using radio telemetry monthly from January 2012 through January of 2013. The greatest upstream movement was 42.5km, and the greatest downstream movement was 22.2km. Most radio tagged fish (69%) departed Alley Spring when daily maximum river water temperature first exceeded that of the spring (14 degrees C) and during increased river discharge. Bioenergetic modelling predicted that a 350g migrating smallmouth bass that used cold-period thermal refuge would grow 16% slower at the same consumption level as a fish that did not seek thermal refuge. Contrary to the bioenergetics models, extrapolation of growth scope results suggested migrating fish grow 29% more than fish using areas of stream with little groundwater influence. Our results contradict previous findings that smallmouth bass are relatively sedentary, provide information about potential cues for migratory behaviour, and give insight to managers regarding use and growth of smallmouth bass in thermally heterogeneous river systems.",NA,JAN,2016,101111eff12192,NA,NA,NA

We studied the behavioural thermoregulation of 33 adult brook charr in a stratified lake using thermo-sensitive radio transmitters that measured hourly individual temperature over one month. The observed behavioural thermoregulatory patterns were consistent between years and suggest the existence of four tactics: two ""warm'' tactics with both crepuscular and finer periodicities, with or without a diel periodicity, and two ""cool'' tactics, with or without a diel periodicity. Telemetry data support the above findings by showing that the different tactics are associated with different patterns of diel horizontal movements. Taken together, our results show a clear spatio-temporal segregation of individuals displaying different tactics, suggesting a reduction of niche overlap.

Thirteen eels were tracked beyond the continental shelf, including 5 eels into the Sargasso Sea. Similar trajectories were found among the tagged eels: they swam against currents towards the eastern part of the spawning area. Estimated net migration speeds in the open ocean ranged from 34.8 to 54.2 km d(-1). In coastal waters, 2 vertical behaviours were observed: (1) repeated up and down movements without a circadian pattern within the first 50 m of the water column and (2) diel vertical migration, with eels swimming to greater depths during daytime (down to 974 m). Eels tracked in the Sargasso Sea all exhibited diel vertical migrations. Eels exhibited significantly greater swimming activity at night, the function of which remains unknown. The daytime and nighttime migration depths varied significantly among individuals and could not be explained by any of the physical factors examined. Some eels appeared to track particular isotherms.

This interpretation ignores species-specific behavioural adaptations in prey that could influence prey capture. Here, we develop and describe a scalable biologging protocol, using animal-borne camera loggers, to elucidate the factors influencing prey capture by a seabird, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua). From the video evidence, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that aggressive behavioural defence mechanisms by prey can deter prey capture by a seabird. Furthermore, we provide evidence demonstrating that these birds, which were observed hunting solitarily, target prey when they are most discernible. Specifically, birds targeted prey primarily while ascending and when prey were not tightly clustered. In conclusion, we show that prey behaviour can significantly influence trophic coupling in marine systems because despite prey being present, it is not always targeted. Thus, these predator-prey relationships should be accounted for in studies using marine top predators as samplers of mid- to lower trophic-level species.",ROYAL SOC,AUG,2018,101098rsos171449,"[Handley, Jonathan M.; Thiebault, Andrea; Pistorius, Pierre] Nelson Mandela Univ, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Dept Zool, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa./[Stanworth, Andrew] Falklands Conservat, POB 26, Stanley FIQQ 1ZZ, Falkland Island./[Schutt, David] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Integrat Biol, POB 173364, Denver, CO 80217 USA.","Handley, JM (reprint author), Nelson Mandela Univ, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Dept Zool, South Campus, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",6124084

This increase was significantly greater for herring than mackerel. As 0-40% of the seine was hauled aboard the fishing vessel, schools changed their spatial distribution and volume independent of seine hauling, while for some schools, depth and height decreased. The acoustic volume backscattering strength was up to 25 dB higher in the centre of the school than in the edges.

From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,JUL,2015,101002ece31529,"[Pennekamp, Frank] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland./[Pennekamp, Frank; Schtickzelle, Nicolas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium./[Petchey, Owen L.] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.","Pennekamp, F (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",4523355

However, vegetation also increases hydraulic roughness and reduces the effective flow area, resulting in an increased water surface elevation for a given streamflow. Balancing the desire to preserve woody vegetation in stream corridors with the need to manage flood risks requires accurate techniques for predicting the influence of vegetation on stream hydraulics. However, this is a challenging problem because woody vegetation responds to the flow field itself by bending and streamlining in response to hydraulic forces. The goal of this study was to predict the bending behaviour of woody riparian vegetation as a function of hydraulic flow conditions. Field tests were performed to elucidate tree biomechanical properties for select riparian taxa of the southwestern USA. Biomechanical results served as input parameters for a numerical algorithm designed to predict tree bending for water velocities likely to be encountered during flood events. Bending simulations revealed appreciable variability in bent tree heights. Variability was likely a manifestation of the extensive variance in plant characteristics and properties inherent in biological specimens. However, no trees were expected to bend to a height lower than approximately 42% of their original height, even in water moving at 2.5m center dot s-1. The results of this work provide an important first step in an effort to predict a dynamic hydraulic roughness for vegetated channels and floodplains under flood conditions.

Flows of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries have the potential to subsidize consumer populations and modify the dynamics of food webs, but how spatio-temporal variations in autochthonous and allochthonous resources affect consumers subsidization remains largely unexplored.
2. We studied spatio-temporal patterns in the allochthonous subsidization of a predator living in a relatively simple ecosystem. We worked on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), where arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus L.) feed preferentially on lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus and Dicrostonyx groenlandicus Traill), and alternatively on colonial greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.). Geese migrate annually from their wintering grounds (where they feed on farmlands and marshes) to the Canadian Arctic, thus generating a strong flow of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries.
3. We examined the influence of spatial variations in availability of geese on the diet of fox cubs (2003-2005) and on fox reproductive output (1996-2005) during different phases of the lemming cycle.
4. Using stable isotope analysis and a simple statistical routine developed to analyse the outputs of a multisource mixing model (SIAR), we showed that the contribution of geese to the diet of arctic fox cubs decreased with distance fromthe goose colony.
5. The probability that a den was used for reproduction by foxes decreased with distance from the subsidized goose colony and increased with lemming abundance. When lemmings were highly abundant, the effect of distance from the colony disappeared. The goose colony thus generated a spatial patterning of reproduction probability of foxes, while the lemming cycle generated a strong temporal variation of reproduction probability of foxes.
6. This study shows how the input of energy owing to the large-scale migration of prey affects the functional and reproductive responses of an opportunistic consumer, and how this input is spatially and temporally modulated through the foraging behaviour of the consumer. Thus, perspectives of both landscape and foraging ecology are needed to fully resolve the effects of subsidies on animal demographic processes and population dynamics.",WILEY-BLACKWELL,MAY,2012,101111j13652656201101944x,"[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Berteaux, Dominique; Lecomte, Nicolas; Szor, Guillaume; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Berteaux, Dominique; Lecomte, Nicolas; Szor, Guillaume; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada./[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Lecomte, Nicolas; Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada./[Giroux, Marie-Andree; Lecomte, Nicolas; Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada./[Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway./[Lecomte, Nicolas; Szor, Guillaume] Govt Nunavut, Dept Environm, Igloolik, NU X0A 0L0, Canada.","Giroux, MA (reprint author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",NA

As a result of loss of aquatic habitats, alligators have adapted to inhabiting human-made lagoons on golf courses and aquatic habitats in close proximity to developed areas. We conducted a telemetry study of adult (> 1.8-m) male alligators between July 2012 and September 2014 on Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of using very-high-frequency (VHF) and Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry in the framework of understanding the spatial ecology of American alligators in a developed landscape. We present both benefits and biases of using these technologies in studies with large, semiaquatic vertebrates. Global Positioning System telemetry produced larger 100% minimum convex polygon home range sizes (range -67.0-1,094.0 ha) when compared with VHF telemetry (range -27.5-596.0 ha). Data collected using a prototype GPS technology custom developed by Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS, Isanti, MN, USA) allowed for the construction of larger, more biologically accurate home ranges. However, VHF telemetry allowed alligators to be detected in underground habitats where they could not be detected with GPS telemetry and yielded more information on behavior and microhabitat through direct observation. We recommend the use of traditional VHF telemetry to allow researchers to directly observe animal behaviors such as reproduction and foraging in conjunction with GPS telemetry to capture previously unavailable locational data. These data highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate telemetry technology based on habitat type, species, and research objectives.

This central-peripheral group structure can arise by self-organization as a result of subordinates fleeing from dominants after losing a fight. However, in real primates, subordinates often avoid interactions with potentially aggressive group members, thereby preventing aggression and subsequent fleeing. Using agent-based modeling, we investigated which spatial and encounter structures emerge when subordinates also avoid known potential aggressors at a distance as compared with the model which only included fleeing after losing a fight (fleeing model). A central-peripheral group structure emerged in most conditions. When avoidance was employed at small or intermediate distances, centrality of dominants emerged similar to the fleeing model, but in a more pronounced way. This result was also found when fleeing after a fight was made independent of dominance rank, i.e. occurred randomly. Employing avoidance at larger distances yielded more spread out groups. This provides a possible explanation of larger group spread in more aggressive species. With avoidance at very large distances, spatially and socially distinct subgroups emerged. We also investigated how encounters were distributed amongst group members. In the fleeing model all individuals encountered all group members equally often, whereas in the avoidance model encounters occurred mostly among similar-ranking individuals. Finally, we also identified a very general and simple mechanism causing a central-peripheral group structure: when individuals merely differed in velocity, faster individuals automatically ended up at the periphery. In summary, a central-peripheral group pattern can easily emerge from individual variation in different movement properties in general, such as fleeing, avoidance or velocity. Moreover, avoidance behavior also affects the encounter structure and can lead to subgroup formation.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,NOV 18,2011,101371journalpone0026189,"[Evers, Ellen; de Vries, Han; Spruijt, Berry M.; Sterck, Elisabeth H.

Coastal barriers may affect the behavior of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin), a salt-tolerant estuarine turtle that requires access to complementary upland habitat for annual nesting. We used telemetry to quantify terrestrial and aquatic movements of 78 nesting female terrapins in response to coastal barriers at 2 sites in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, a heavily developed estuary. Nesting female terrapins traveled significantly greater distances with more tortuous paths or spent significantly more time in the water when their movements were obstructed than females nesting at beaches with no obstructions. We hypothesize that the additional effort and displacement associated with reproduction where obstructions exist will reduce terrapin fitness and potentially contribute to population declines. Our study demonstrates a unique approach to quantifying effects of barriers on organisms requiring complementary habitats, and improves our understanding of the impacts of shoreline hardening on estuarine wildlife threatened by encroaching coastal development.

Using an automated acoustic telemetry system, we tracked individual positions of adult perch in a whole natural lake for about 1 year and compared several model frameworks for the individual responses to water temperature. The best-fit model revealed that rising water temperature led to an increase in both between-and within-individual variation in activity, thereby stabilizing behavioral repeatability across temperature. Further, including temporal autocorrelation significantly improved the model performance, suggesting that consistent individual differences in behavior could be partially explained by factors such as slowly changing states in the wild.

From late April through September 1990, we radiotracked 25 dusky-footed woodrats representing both sexes and a cross section of age classes (ad, subad, and juv). Animals were captured in sapling/poletimber shrubfields resulting from past clearcut timber harvest. In northwestern California woodrats reach their highest densities in this seral stage. During evening radiotracking sessions, we detected intermittent, short distance movements of juvenile and subadult males and females, and adult females from shrubfields into adjacent old-growth forests occupied by spotted owls. None of the radiotagged woodrats permanently emigrated to older-aged forests during our study period. Between-year emigration from shrubfield to old forest, however, mas documented for marked individuals. Our telemetry results indicate that woodrats are not averse to crossing sharp ecotonal boundaries from shrubfieIds into adjacent old forest, into canopy openings in these forests, or into natural openings within dense shrubfields. A substantial number of our radiotagged woodrats were killed by predators, with carcasses most often (5 of 9 depredated woodrats) found in adjacent old forest. These observations suggest that during these between-habitat forays, woodrats may be more vulnerable to avian and mammal predators. Therefore, to some degree, the existence of brushy shrubfields adjacent to older forest may increase the availability of woodrats to predators, such as spotted owls, that exploit prey from a variety of habitats but spend the majority of their time hunting in late seral stage forests.",WILDLIFE SOC,APR,1997,1023073802590,"US FOREST SERV,PACIFIC SW RES STN,REDWOOD SCI LAB,ARCATA,CA 95521.",NA,NA

By means of a field-experiment, we evaluated variation in zonal recovery of two sympatric riparian Pardosa wolf spiders after releasing individuals offshore from a non-familiar river bank. After acclimatisation under controlled laboratory conditions, both species showed strong directional movements towards the natal river bank shore. Additionally, the more stenotopic riparian wolf spider showed considerable between-individual variation in orientation behaviour. In conclusion, information with respect to an individual's origin acts as an important cue for wolf spider orientation during movement. Our findings provide insights into decision-making processes in stressful situations and point to between-population variation in orientation behaviour, which relates to inherited factors and/or early-life (learned) experience.

FOREST; PLANT",NA,"Background: Nut-bearing trees, including oaks (Quercus spp.), are considered to be highly dispersal limited, leading to concerns about their ability to colonize new sites or migrate in response to climate change. However, estimating seed dispersal is challenging in species that are secondarily dispersed by animals, and differences in disperser abundance or behavior could lead to large spatio-temporal variation in dispersal ability. Parentage and dispersal analyses combining genetic and ecological data provide accurate estimates of current dispersal, while spatial genetic structure (SGS) can shed light on past patterns of dispersal and establishment.
Methodology and Principal Findings: In this study, we estimate seed and pollen dispersal and parentage for two mixed-species red oak populations using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. We compare these results to those of a genetic ML parentage model. We also test whether observed patterns of SGS in three size cohorts are consistent with known site history and current dispersal patterns. We find that, while pollen dispersal is extensive at both sites, the scale of seed dispersal differs substantially. Parentage results differ between models due to additional data included in Bayesian model and differing genotyping error assumptions, but both indicate between-site dispersal differences. Patterns of SGS in large adults, small adults, and seedlings are consistent with known site history (farmed vs. selectively harvested), and with long-term differences in seed dispersal. This difference is consistent with predator/disperser satiation due to higher acorn production at the low-dispersal site. While this site-to-site variation results in substantial differences in asymptotic spread rates, dispersal for both sites is substantially lower than required to track latitudinal temperature shifts.
Conclusions: Animal-dispersed trees can exhibit considerable spatial variation in seed dispersal, although patterns may be surprisingly constant over time. However, even under favorable conditions, migration in heavy-seeded species is likely to lag contemporary climate change.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 1,2012,101371journalpone0036492,"[Moran, Emily V.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA./[Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","Moran, EV (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",10_1371_journal_pone_0036492

Based on spatially-explicit behavioural observations from coyotes Canis latrans in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, we estimated resource selection for specific behaviours (i.e. predatory, laying and travelling) and for all used locations irrespective of behaviour, to test whether resource selection is behaviour-specific and not generalizable across behaviours. Behaviour-specific models differed significantly from the model not partitioned by behaviour. In particular, the predatory model identified selection for mesic-meadows which have previously been documented to have high small-mammal abundance. The non-partitioned model, however, showed avoidance of this vegetation type.

In the experiment, we observed both uni- and bi-directional traffic flow. The headway-speed relationships indicate that the ants showed the same sensitivity to the distance headway in the two types of flow. For bi-directional traffic flow, head-on encounters and giving-way behavior between ants moving in opposing directions were a common occurrence. It took one unloaded ant 2.61 s to solve a head-on encounter with another unloaded ant. Compared with unloaded ants, loaded ants had a lower moving speed, but were less likely to be impacted by a head-on encounter. In the observation region, both sudden stop and head-on encounters contained two phases: deceleration and acceleration. Our analysis indicates that the relaxation time in the deceleration process is less than that in the acceleration process. The reduction of movement efficiency of encountering two discontinuous ants is larger than that when encountering two successive ants (0.18). This is owing to the absence of head-on encounters with following ants.

It is usually measured by summing straight-line distances between intermittently sampled locations along continuous animal movement paths. The extent to which this approach underestimates travel distance remains a rarely addressed and unsolved problem, largely because true movement paths are rarely, if ever, available for comparison. Here, we use simulated movement paths parameterized with empirical movement data to study how estimates of distance travelled are affected by sampling frequency. 2. We used a novel method to obtain fine-scale characteristics of animal movement from camera trap videos for a set of tropical forest mammals and used these characteristics to generate detailed movement paths. We then sampled these paths at different frequencies, simulating telemetry studies, and quantified the accuracy of sampled travel distance estimation. 3. For our focal species, typical telemetry studies would underestimate distances travelled by 6793%, and extremely high sampling frequencies (several fixes per minute) would be required to get tolerably accurate estimates. The form of the relationship between tortuosity, sample frequency, and distance travelled was such that absolute distance cannot accurately be estimated by the infrequent samples used in typical tracking studies. 4. We conclude that the underestimation of distance travelled is a serious but underappreciated problem. Currently, there is no reliable, widely applicable method to obtain approximately unbiased estimates of distance travelled by animals.

A previous study investigated how bats adapted their echolocation behavior when tracking a moving target in the presence of a stationary distracter at different distances and angular offsets. The use of only one distracter, however, left open the possibility that a bat could reduce the interference of the distracter by turning its head. Here, bats tracked a moving target in the presence of one or two symmetrically placed distracters to investigate adaptive echolocation behavior in a situation where vocalizing off-axis would result in increased interference from distracter echoes. Both bats reduced bandwidth and duration but increased sweep rate in more challenging distracter conditions, and surprisingly, made more head turns in the two-distracter condition compared to one, but only when distracters were placed at large angular offsets. However, for most variables examined, subjects showed distinct strategies to reduce clutter interference, either by (1) changing spectral or temporal features of their calls, or (2) producing large numbers of sonar sound groups and consistent head-turning behavior.

We used analytical approaches, developed to cope with ""big data"", that require no 'a priori' assumptions about the behaviour of the target agents, to analyse a pooled tracking dataset of 272 elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) in the Southern Ocean, that was comprised of >500,000 location estimates collected over more than a decade. Our analyses showed that the displacements of these seals were described by a truncated power law distribution across several spatial and temporal scales, with a clear signature of directed movement. This pattern was evident when analysing the aggregated tracks despite a wide diversity of individual trajectories. We also identified marine provinces that described the migratory and foraging habitats of these seals. Our analysis provides evidence for the presence of intrinsic drivers of movement, such as memory, that cannot be detected using common models of movement behaviour. These results highlight the potential for ""big data"" techniques to provide new insights into movement behaviour when applied to large datasets of animal tracking.",NA,MAR 8,2017,101038s41598017001650,NA,NA,10_1038_s41598_017_00165_0

Big data-enabled research has substantially enhanced our understanding of human population distribution and dynamics, land use, travel behavior, movement patterns, and spatial social networks from city to country to global levels. However, the effectiveness of big data-enabled social sensing can be undermined by five critical issues related to research design: data volume, spatial coverage, locational information quality, and representativeness across socioeconomic and demographic groups.

Haul-out behaviour may be affected by biological (e.g. sex, age and condition) and physical factors (e.g. food availability and environmental conditions), and identifying these factors may help explain the spatiotemporal distribution and habitat use of pinnipeds. The aim of this study is to describe observed winter haul-out patterns of adult Weddell seals in the Weddell Sea and investigate the role of potential predictors to gain insight into the way these animals interact with the physical environment in this region. We examined the haul-out behaviour in relation to available biological (i.e., diving effort, sex) and physical information (i.e., sun angle). Thirty-three satellite telemetry tags were deployed on adult Weddell seals in the southern Weddell Sea during February 2007, 2009 and 2011, following their annual moult recording information on the behavioural mode of the animal: at surface, hauled out or diving. At the end of the austral summer Weddell seals spent, on average, more than 40% of their time hauled out on the ice. Under constant light conditions, it appears that physiological factors drive sex differences in the timing and duration of haul-out behaviour, with females spending on average more time hauled out than males during daylight hours. This time spent hauled-out declined to around 15% in both sexes by the beginning of autumn and remained at this level with a clear nocturnal haul-out pattern during the winter. The time spent diving increased during this period, indicating an increase in foraging effort during the winter months, and led to a common haul-out pattern in both sexes over winter. We found a positive relationship between haul-out duration and the percentage of time spent diving prior to a haul-out in both sexes, with the exception of female daytime haul-outs early in the year.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,MAY 19,2016,101371journalpone0155817,"[Boehme, Lars; Baker, Amy; Fedak, Mike; Biuw, Martin; Photopoulou, Theoni] Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland./[Arthun, Marius; Nicholls, Keith] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England./[Robinson, Patrick; Costa, Dan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA./[Arthun, Marius] Univ Bergen, Inst Geophys, Bergen, Norway./[Arthun, Marius] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway./[Biuw, Martin] Akvaplan Niva, Tromso, Norway./[Photopoulou, Theoni] Univ Cape Town, Dept Stat Sci, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.","Boehme, L (reprint author), Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",10_1371_journal_pone_0155817

Environmental context is added at ever finer scales using remote sensing earth observation data. Here we showcase the use of such bio-logging approaches in a conservation physiology study on endangered Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis). We determine environmental, behavioural, and physiological causes of survival in immature birds that roam from wintering sites in India, Bhutan, and Nepal towards summer areas in Tibet and Mongolia. Five of 18 immature griffons died during one year. Individuals that died had failed to migrate sufficiently far northward (> 1500 km) in spring. Individuals likely died if they flew against headwinds from the north or were less able to find thermal updrafts. Surviving individuals migrated to cold and dry areas with low population density. We highlight flight experience, long distance movements, and remote places with low human population as factors critical for the survival of Himalayan vultures.

Although in some cases these ecological studies could reveal transmitter effects on behavior and mortality, experiments conducted under controlled conditions can provide valuable information to understand the influence of implanted tags on health and physiology. We report the clinical, mass, biochemical, and histological responses of captive Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) implanted with PTTs with percutaneous antennas. We trained 6 individuals to dive 4.9 m for their food, allowed them to acclimate to this dive depth, and implanted them with PTTs. We collected data before surgery to establish baselines, and for 3.5 mo after surgery. The first feeding dive took place 22 hr after surgery, with 5 of 6 birds diving to the bottom within 35 hr of surgery. Plumage waterproofing around surgical sites was reduced <= 21 days after surgery. Mass; albumin; albumin: globulin ratio; aspartate aminotransferase; beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and gamma-globulins; creatine kinase; fecal glucocorticoid metabolites; heterophil: lymphocyte ratio; and packed cell volume changed from baseline on one or more of the postsurgery sampling dates, and some changes were still evident 3.5 mo after surgery. Our findings show that Common Eiders physiologically responded for up to 3.5 mo after surgical implantation of a PTT, with the greatest response occurring within the first few weeks of implantation. These responses support the need for postsurgery censor periods for satellite telemetry data and should be considered when designing studies and analyzing information from PTTs in sea ducks.",COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,AUG,2016,101650CONDOR1671,"[Latty, Christopher J.; Powell, Abby N.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA./[Hollmen, Tuula E.; Andrews, Russel D.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska SeaLife Ctr, Seward, AK USA./[Hollmen, Tuula E.; Andrews, Russel D.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Seward, AK USA./[Petersen, Margaret R.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK USA./[Powell, Abby N.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, US Geol Survey, Alaska Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK USA./[Latty, Christopher J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arctic Natl Wildlife Refuge, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA./[Powell, Abby N.] Univ Florida, US Geol Survey, Florida Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Gainesville, FL USA.","Latty, CJ (reprint author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.; Latty, CJ (reprint author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arctic Natl Wildlife Refuge, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA.",NA

However, the behavior of biodiesel, or blends of biodiesel with fossil diesel, in the marine environment have yet to be fully understood. Hence, we performed a series of initial laboratory experiments and simple calculations to evaluate the microbial and environmental fate of FAMEs. Aerobic seawater microcosms spiked with biodiesel or mixtures of biodiesel and fossil diesel revealed that the FAMEs were degraded at roughly the same rate as n-alkanes, and more rapidly than other hydrocarbon components. The residues extracted from these different microcosms became indistinguishable within weeks. Preliminary results from physical-chemical calculations suggest that FAMEs in biodiesel mixtures will not affect the evaporation rates of spilled petroleum hydrocarbons but may stabilize oil droplets in the water column and thereby facilitate transport.

Congdon, Bradley C.",NA,NA,NA,"Dingoes (Canis dingo) in the coastal lowlands of Australia's Wet Tropics are perceived as a major threat to biodiversity and subjected to broad-spectrum lethal control. However, evidence of their impacts is equivocal, and control programmes generally ignore the ecological benefits that dingoes might provide. Previous diet analysis has shown that dingoes in the Wet Tropics primarily prey on common, terrestrial mammals. However, little is known of dingo habitat use or prey acquisition in the region despite these activities having major implications for biodiversity conservation. We investigated land use by dingoes in the lowland Wet Tropics to enable predictions of potential prey types, relative prey use and modes of prey acquisition. Nine dingoes were tracked for 3-6months. Home ranges and resting areas were estimated using multiple estimators, and habitat use was analysed using compositional analysis of habitat use and generalized additive models. Dingo ranging behaviour suggested that anthropogenic food subsidies were infrequently used. Each territory comprised several sclerophyll forest rest areas with adjacent sugarcane-grassland high activity areas. Individuals used each rest-activity area for extended durations before moving on to another. Sclerophyll and rainforests, which contain the fauna species of primary conservation concern, were generally used for rest/sleep, or movement between rest-activity areas. Activity patterns were consistent with dingoes hunting in open sugarcane-grassland habitats during daylight hours. Dingo activity was low in areas where fauna species of conservation concern occur, which suggests that dingoes do not pose a threat to their survival. Consequently, current broad-spectrum lethal control may have minimal benefits or even incur costs for biodiversity. Maximizing the ecosystem services provided by dingoes while simultaneously minimizing their negative impacts requires a more targeted location-specific management approach, one that assesses and mitigates impacts specifically where background circumstances suggest particular packs may be either a conservation or economic threat.",NA,MAY,2017,101111aec12427,NA,NA,NA

Millions are taken annually in pelagic longline fisheries and comprise the highest component of auctioned fin weight in the international shark fin trade. Though studies of blue sharks outnumber those of other large pelagic sharks, the species' complicated and sexually segregated life history still confound current understanding of Atlantic movement patterns. Lack of detailed information regarding movement and vertical behavior continues to limit management efforts that require such data for stock assessment and sustainable catch modeling. Therefore, this study aims to describe behavioral and ecological patterns distinct to aggregating and migrating blue sharks, and compare the findings to existing Atlantic movement models.
Results: Data collected from 23 blue sharks instrumented with pop-up satellite archival tags were used in statistical predictive regression models to investigate habitat use during a localized aggregation in the northwest Atlantic, while undergoing seasonal migrations, and with respect to environmental variables. Deployment durations ranged from 4 to 273 days, with sharks inhabiting both productive coastal waters and the open ocean, and exhibiting long-distance seasonal movements exceeding 3700 km. While aggregating on the continental shelf of the northwest Atlantic, blue sharks displayed consistent depth use independent of sex and life stage, and exhibited varied response to environmental (temperature and chlorophyll a) factors. As sharks dispersed from the aggregation site, depth use was influenced by bathymetry, latitude, demography, and presence in the Gulf Stream. Mature females were not observed at the New England tagging site, however, two mature females with recent mating wounds were captured and tagged opportunistically in The Bahamas, one of which migrated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Conclusions: Vertical behaviors displayed by blue sharks varied greatly among locales; depth use off the continental shelf was significantly greater, and individuals exhibited a greater frequency of deep-diving behavior, compared to periods of aggregation on the continental shelf. Sexual segregation was evident, suggesting mature and immature males, and immature females may be subjected to high levels of anthropogenic exploitation in this region during periods of aggregation. Analysis of the spatio-temporal tracks revealed that nine individuals traveled beyond the United States EEZ, including a mature female captured in The Bahamas that migrated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These results reflect and augment existing Atlantic migration models, and highlight the complex, synergistic nature of factors affecting blue shark ecology and the need for a cooperative management approach in the North Atlantic.",BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,JUL 18,2017,101186s404620170107z,"[Howey, Lucy A.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Shark Res Ctr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA./[Howey, Lucy A.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA./[Wetherbee, Bradley M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol, Kingston, RI 02881 USA./[Howey, Lucy A.; Tolentino, Emily R.] Microwave Telemetry Inc, 8835 Columbia 100 Pkwy,Suites K&L, Columbia, MD 21045 USA.","Howey, LA (reprint author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Shark Res Ctr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.; Howey, LA (reprint author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.; Howey, LA (reprint author), Microwave Telemetry Inc, 8835 Columbia 100 Pkwy,Suites K&L, Columbia, MD 21045 USA.",10_1186_s40462_017_0107_z

We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging withmetrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned inmeasuring phenotypic responses to short-termclimate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,JUL 3,2018,103389fevo201800092,"[Chmura, Helen E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Neurobiol Physiol & Behav, Davis, CA 95616 USA./[Chmura, Helen E.; Williams, Cory T.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA./[Glass, Thomas W.; Williams, Cory T.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA./[Glass, Thomas W.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Arctic Beringia Program, Fairbanks, AK USA.","Williams, CT (reprint author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.; Williams, CT (reprint author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",10_3389_fevo_2018_00092

To define the state of knowledge for how weak acidification influences freshwater biota and ecosystems, a review of the primary literature was conducted. Despite few empirical studies focused on weak acidification in the primary literature (similar to 100 studies), some themes have emerged from our literature review. Most studies focused on physiological responses at the organismal level, and fish were the most studied taxa. Animals exhibited reduced individual growth rates, and, in contrast, primary producers demonstrated increased individual and population growth rates. In animals, mortality, sub-lethal injuries, and changes to behaviours were also observed. Negative consequences to reproduction in macrophytes were found. Few studies have focused on population, community, or ecosystem levels, though broad scale studies suggest that weak acidification can limit species community diversity, specifically in invertebrates and fish. Moving forward, researchers need to continue to advance our understanding of the consequences of weak acidification for freshwater biota. Furthermore, priority should be placed on research that can evaluate the potential for weak acidification in freshwater to lead to changes in ecological regimes or economical outcomes, such as fisheries collapses.",SPRINGER,JAN,2018,101007s107500173332y,"[Hasler, Caleb T.; Jeffrey, Jennifer D.; Schneider, Eric V.

Point-light animations depicting the BM of a walking hen successfully facilitated both the approach activity during imprinting and the learned preference in the test, although significant positive correlations did not appear between these at the individual level. Furthermore, scrambling the light points did not significantly reduce the effects, whereas linear motion of a hen-shaped set of points had no effect. If pretreated with the linear motion, those chicks primed with a high BM preference score showed a high learning score in subsequent imprinting. We conclude that the local movement feature of the BM animation is critical in making chicks approach and learn the associated colour. We propose a scenario wherein naive chicks have an innate preference for BM, which arises prior to imprinting through nonspecific visual experience in the early posthatch period. The induced BM preference then allows chicks to form a learned colour preference for the associated colour more effectively, leading to the development of tighter social attachment.

Predator presence can be considered a natural high-level disturbance stimulus to which prey animals have evolved adaptive response strategies to reduce their risk of predation by altering behavior away from fitness-enhancing activities such as foraging. By contrasting the type and magnitude (duration, severity, consistency) of behavioral responses to anthropogenic noise and playback of killer whale (KW) sounds that simulated predator presence, this study aimed to provide a relative index of the disturbance level as an indication of the biological significance of responses to the anthropogenic stimulus. Using multi-sensor tags as well as visual observations of surface behavior of adult male sperm whales, we assessed a comprehensive range of behavioral metrics that could reduce individuals' fitness if altered for a biologically relevant duration. Combining previously published results and new analyses, we showed that the responses to 1-2 kHz upsweep naval sonar and to KW playback were very similar, including horizontal avoidance, interruption of foraging or resting activities and an increase in social sound production. However, only KW playbacks elicited grouping behaviors, indicating that this social response component was specific to predator detection. Animals responded to a lesser extent to 6-7 kHz upsweep naval sonar, indicating weaker disturbance effects. Our study demonstrates the benefit of using anti-predator responses as a reference of disturbance when evaluating the relative impacts of anthropogenic stimuli, which can be of particular interest in studies of threatened species such as sperm whales.",NA,NA,2016,103354esr00748,NA,NA,10_3354_esr00748

Scale mismatch","The African elephant is an important keystone species that may have significant effects on ecosystem structure and eco-tourism revenues. In Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, where elephant populations have been increasing, management have-adopted a zonation approach, with zones identified for specific and measurable management interventions to control elephant populations, or to reduce conflict with humans. Localised culling is one proposed management intervention. The zones, partly derived from static annual elephant distribution surveys, are intended to encompass only localised effects on elephant within that zone, assuming no effect into adjacent undisturbed zones, or into contiguous neighbouring landholdings outside KNP. We deployed 17 GPS/GSM collars on free-roaming elephant herds within KNP to assess their seasonal home-range use and size and daily movement paths. These temporally robust movement metrics were analyzed against the Park's elephant management zones, partly derived from sporadic telemetry fixes and static distribution counts. Multiple daily and seasonal spatial shifts by elephant across neighbouring zones, including into adjacent reserves, rendered the principle of exclusive zoning at this management scale incorrect. The KNP management zones and proposed management actions are not biologically relevant to elephant, or appropriate for managing the ecological or human-wildlife impact of elephant, resulting in spatial and temporal scale mismatches. We predict that the intended management actions, specifically culling, and its resultant intended consequences (immigration, reduced vegetation impact and reduced growth due to disturbance) is not localised to the target zone, and, because it is season specific, is at risk of targeting transient non-resident elephant whilst missing resident elephant that have crossed into other zones. This scale mismatch may have a ripple effect outside the target zone, causing serious ecological risks, especially given the documented long-term negative effects of management disturbance on elephant. We further quantify this scale mismatch into four categories based on percentages of the following factors: the proportion of sampled population affected, the seasonal zone occupancy (the proportion of locations per zone per season) and number of zone crossings, and the governance of management units (consistency of management interventions imposed across zones). This generates a prediction of the risk of this exclusive zoning and its consequences. We suggest a new approach, whereby, known elephant intensity of use at local scales is adaptively managed for specific management objectives. However, management must occur within a known and contained zone of influence defined by elephant behaviour derived from resident movement studies, as opposed to broad scale zonation at the population or park level.

The majority of existing studies that have explored the relationship between recovery and gait biomechanics have been conducted in laboratory settings. However, seamless gait parameter monitoring in real-world conditions may provide a better understanding of recovery post-surgery. The purpose of this study was to estimate kinematic and kinetic gait variables using two ankle-worn wearable sensors in individuals after unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Eighteen subjects at least six months post-unilateral total knee arthroplasty participated in this study. Four biomechanical gait variables were measured using an instrumented split-belt treadmill and motion capture systems. Concurrently, eleven inertial gait variables were extracted from two ankle-worn accelerometers. Subsets of the inertial gait variables for each biomechanical gait variable estimation were statistically selected. Then, hierarchical regressions were created to determine the directional contributions of the inertial gait variables for biomechanical gait variable estimations. Selected inertial gait variables significantly predicted trial-averaged biomechanical gait variables. Moreover, strong directionally-aligned relationships were observed. Wearable-based gait monitoring of multiple and sequential kinetic gait variables in daily life could provide a more accurate understanding of the relationships between movement patterns and recovery from total knee arthroplasty.",MDPI,MAY,2018,103390s18051577,"[Youn, Ik-Hyun] Mokpo Natl Maritime Univ, Div Nav & Informat Syst, Mokpo 58628, South Korea./[Youn, Jong-Hoon] Univ Nebraska, Dept Comp Sci, Omaha, NE 68182 USA./[Zeni, Joseph A.] Univ Delaware, Dept Phys Therapy, Newark, DE 19716 USA./[Knarr, Brian A.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biomech, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.","Youn, IH (reprint author), Mokpo Natl Maritime Univ, Div Nav & Informat Syst, Mokpo 58628, South Korea.",NA

We studied the biomechanics of the aerial righting reflex in first-instar nymphs of the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. After being released upside-down, insects reoriented dorsoventrally and stabilized body posture via active modulation of limb positions and associated aerodynamic torques. We identified specific reflexes for bilaterally asymmetric leg displacements which elicit body rotation and subsequently stabilize mid-air posture. Coordinated appendicular movements thus improve torsional manoeuvrability in the absence of wings, as may have characterized the initial origins of controlled aerial behaviour in arthropods. Design of small aerial or multimodal robotic vehicles may similarly benefit from use of such strategies for flight control.",NA,JAN 6,2017,101098rsfs20160075,NA,NA,5206595

However, a predator may attack laterally and posteriorly oriented prey if it can couple the strikes with rapid body reorientation. Here, we examined omnidirectional strikes in flattie spiders (Selenopidae), a group of sit-and-wait ambush predators found on open surfaces. These spiders attack prey throughout their entire peripheral range using rapid strikes that consist of rapid translation and rotation toward the prey. These spiders ambush with radially oriented, long, laterigrade legs in a ready-to-fire status. Once prey is detected, the spider maneuvers toward it using a single flexion of the legs closest to the prey, which is assisted by 0-3 extension strides by the contralateral legs. The within-stance joint actions by a few legs generate a large resultant force directed toward the prey and a large turning moment. Furthermore, the turning speed is enhanced by rapid midair leg adductions, which effectively reduce the spider's moment of inertia during angular acceleration. Our results demonstrate a novel hunting behavior with high maneuverability that is generated with effectively controlled reconfigurations of long, laterigrade legs. These results provide insights for understanding the diversity of animal legs and developing highly maneuverable multi-legged robots.",COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,APR,2018,101242jeb166512,"[Zeng, Yu] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Nat Sci, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA./[Zeng, Yu] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3040 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA./[Crews, Sarah] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Entomol, Golden Gate Pk,55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA./[Zeng, Yu] UCMerced, Room347,Sci & Engn Bldg 1,5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.","Zeng, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Merced, Sch Nat Sci, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.; Zeng, Y (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3040 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Zeng, Y (reprint author), UCMerced, Room347,Sci & Engn Bldg 1,5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",NA

exchange; larval ingress; recruitment; larval fishes","Selective tidal stream transport is hypothesized as a dominant mechanism by which larvae of marine animals move through estuarine openings. For larvae moving from the shelf to estuarine habitats, selective tidal stream transport proposes that larvae are higher in the water column during flood tide and lower in the water column during ebb tide. Although a number of studies conclude that selective tidal stream transport is the mechanism responsible for larval ingress, few studies consider alternative mechanisms or consider passive explanations for tidal patterns in larval distributions. We examined the biophysical mechanisms responsible for larval ingress into Chesapeake Bay using an Eulerian approach. We made flux calculations for 3 species and partitioned flux estimates among 3 different ingress mechanisms (wind forcing, residual bottom inflow and tidal). For the Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus (Sciaenidae), all 3 mechanisms of ingress contributed to the net up-estuary flux of larvae, but tidal mechanisms become more important for larger sizes. Net up-estuary flux of the Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus (Clupeidae) was dominated by residual bottom inflow and wind forcing. Ingress of the summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus (Para-lichthyidae) was dominated by tidal mechanisms, and the importance of tides increased with developmental stage. We found little evidence for the hypothesis that tidal patterns in larval distributions resulted from passive processes (water mass-specific distributions, buoyancy, vertical mixing), thereby supporting the hypothesis that tidal patterns resulted from active behaviors. However, our estimates of vertical mixing were not direct and additional work is needed to examine the role of vertical mixing in influencing vertical distributions in areas with strong tides. We conclude that a combination of wind forcing, residual bottom inflow, and selective tidal stream transport are responsible for the ingress of larval fishes into Chesapeake Bay, and that the relative importance of the 3 mechanisms differs among species and changes with larval development.",INTER-RESEARCH,NA,2005,103354meps303295,"NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NCCOS, Ctr Coastal Fisheries & Habitat Res, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA./Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Quantitat Fisheries Ecol, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA./Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.","Hare, JA (reprint author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NEFSC, Narragansett Lab, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA.",10_3354_meps303295

Potential risks and rewards, such as prey, predators, conspecifics or non-biological obstacles, must be detected so that an animal can modify its behaviour accordingly. However, to date few studies have considered how animals in the wild focus their attention. Dolphins and porpoises are known to actively use sonar or echolocation. A newly developed miniature data logger attached to a porpoise allows for individual recording of acoustical search efforts and inspection distance based on echolocation. In this study, we analysed the biosonar behaviour of eight free-ranging finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) and demonstrated that these animals inspect the area ahead of them before swimming silently into it. The porpoises inspected distances up to 77 in, whereas their swimming distance without using sonar was less than 20 in. The inspection distance was long enough to ensure a wide safety margin before facing real risks or rewards. Once a potential prey item was detected, porpoises adjusted their inspection distance from the remote target throughout their approach.",ROYAL SOC,APR 22,2005,101098rspb20043024,"Natl Res Inst Fisheries Engn, Ibaraki 3140421, Japan./Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China./Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo 1738515, Japan.","Akamatsu, T (reprint author), Natl Res Inst Fisheries Engn, Ibaraki 3140421, Japan.",NA

Possible foraging occurred mostly near the surface or at the bottom of a dive. The porpoises showed individual diversity in biosonar activity (<100 to >50,000 clicks per hour) and in dive frequency (6179 dives per hour). We confirm that wild harbor porpoises use more intense clicks than captive animals. A positive tendency between number of dives and clicks per hour was found for a subadult male, which stayed near shore. It showed a distinct day-night cycle with low echolocation rates during the day, but five times higher rates and higher dive activity at night. A female traveling in open waters showed no diel rhythm, but its sonar activity was three times higher compared to the males'.

A satellite tag was attached to one animal while an acoustic A-tag, a time-depth recorder and a VHF transmitter complex was attached to a second dolphin with a suction cup. The satellite tag transmitted for 201 day, during which time the dolphin stayed in the coastal waters of western Iceland. The acoustic tag complex was on the second animal for 13 h and 40 min and provided the first insight into the echolocation behaviour of a free-ranging white-beaked dolphin. The tag registered 162 dives. The dolphin dove to a maximum depth of 45 m, which is about the depth of the bay in which the dolphin was swimming. Two basic types of dives were identified; U-shaped and V-shaped dives. The dolphin used more time in U-shaped dives, more clicks and sonar signals with shorter click intervals compared to those it used in V-shaped dives. The dolphin was in acoustic contact with other dolphins about five hours after it was released and stayed with these for the rest of the tagging time. Possible foraging attempts were found based on the reduction of click intervals from about 100 ms to 2-3 ms, which suggests a prey capture attempt. We found 19 punitive prey capture attempts and of these 53% occurred at the maximum dive depth. This suggests that more than half of the possible prey capture events occurred at or near the sea bed.

We converted a commercially available global positioning system (GPS) product into a low-cost tracking device that sends data via the mobile phone network, and assessed its performance under varying conditions. We established a stationary test, deploying devices along a continuum from open urban areas to topographically and structurally complex forested sites. We tested three features of the device: (a) the GPS, by measuring fix success rate, fix precision and horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), (b) remote download capacity via the mobile phone network and (c) battery drain. Measures of GPS performance demonstrated high fix success rates and precision. HDOP values were influenced by habitat type and topographical position, but generally remained very low, giving an acceptable degree of error for most applications in wildlife research. Devices experienced delayed data transmission at sites with less phone reception, and faster battery drain at sites with denser vegetation. We recorded device malfunctions in 8.2% of the 110 sampling locations, but these were not associated with habitat type or topography. Our device was effective under a wide range of conditions, and the development process we used provides guidance to other researchers aiming to develop cost-effective wildlife trackers.
